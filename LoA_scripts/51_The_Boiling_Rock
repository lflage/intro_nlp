The scene opens to the Western Air Temple at nightfall. Zuko is pouring tea to give to the members of Team Avatar.


Zuko

[Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups.] No one can make tea like Uncle [Camera pans up to Zuko's face.], but hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?


Katara

Sure. [Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire.]


Aang

I like jokes.


Toph

Bring it!


Zuko

Okay. [Serves tea to The Duke and Haru and stands up with his tray.] Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line [The boys help themselves to the tea.] is "Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!" [No response.] Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.


Katara

Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.




Everyone else laughs. Zuko smiles a little.


Toph

It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens.




Zuko hands tea to Teo and Toph. He subsequently approaches Sokka.


Sokka

Hey, can I talk to you for a second? [Stands up and walks out.]




Zuko sets down the tray of tea. The camera switches to a shot of him and Sokka walking away from where the rest of the group is gathered.


Zuko

So, what's up? [Appa wakes up and looks as they walk past him.]


Sokka

If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?


Zuko

What do you mean? Who was captured?


Sokka

When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be.


Zuko

I can't tell you.


Sokka

What? Why not?


Zuko

Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. [Turns to leave, but is stopped by Sokka.]


Sokka

It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.


Zuko

It's not good, Sokka.


Sokka

Please.


Zuko

My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.


Sokka

What's that?


Zuko

The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. [Sokka looks at him, horrified.] It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable.


Sokka

So, where is this place?


Zuko

Why do you need to know? What are you planning?


Sokka

Nothing. [Pauses for a moment.] Boy, you're so paranoid.


Zuko

It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.


Sokka

Thanks, Zuko. [Yawns.] Just knowing makes me feel better.


Zuko

[Sarcastically.] Yeah, I'm sure it does.




Fade to later that night. With everyone asleep, Sokka sneaks away from everyone. He sighs and almost steps on Momo, narrowly avoiding tripping over him and waking him up. He climbs onto Appa, who awakes.


Sokka

[To Appa.] Shhh.




Appa goes back to sleep, as Sokka climbs on top of him. However, as he climbs up, he notices Zuko is already in the saddle with his arms crossed.


Zuko

Not up to anything, huh?


Sokka

[Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out.] Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?


Zuko

I'm never happy.


Sokka

[Picking up the fallen items.] Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. [Zuko jumps off of Appa.] It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. [Pushes Zuko aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.]


Zuko

You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.


Sokka

No. I have to do this alone.


Zuko

How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares. [Sokka stops climbing, sighs, and looks back at Zuko.] We'll take my war balloon. [They walk off to the war balloon.]




Cut to Appa and Momo, still sleeping at sunrise. The Duke gives Appa some hay. Katara notices that Momo is holding a note.


Toph

What does it say?


Katara

"Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko." [As she says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down.] One more thing. "Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko."




A badgerfrog croaks, waking Aang from his rest.


Aang

[Sighs.] Nobody else has homework. [Stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk away.] One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...




Scene cuts to Zuko and Sokka in the air in the war balloon. Zuko blasts fire into the tank to keep it moving. A moment of awkward silence between the two follows.


Sokka

Pretty clouds.


Zuko

Yeah ... fluffy. [Sokka whistles.] What?


Sokka

What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.


Zuko

No kidding.


Sokka

Yep, a balloon ... but for war.


Zuko

If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. [Blasts more fire into the tank.]


Sokka

Yeah, it seems to run in the family.


Zuko

[Looks at Sokka, defensively.] Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.


Sokka

I know, I know, you've changed.


Zuko

[Downcast.] I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down.


Sokka

I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.


Zuko

It wasn't that hard.


Sokka

Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?


Zuko

Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai.


Sokka

[Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest.] That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?


Zuko

[Smiles.] Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.


Sokka

My first girlfriend turned into the moon.


Zuko

[Shocked for a moment. Looks up at the sky briefly, before glancing back at Sokka.] That's rough, buddy.




Nightfall. Sokka is asleep, snoring loudly. Zuko continues to keep the tank full. He stops to look out in the distance.


Zuko

There it is! [Sokka awakens to see it.] There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.




As they enter the volcano's steam, the balloon begins losing altitude quickly.


Zuko

[Frantically blasting fire into the tank.] We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore! [Blasts fire up into the balloon.]


Sokka

The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!


Zuko

[Falls to the side as the balloon tips.] So what are we supposed to do?


Sokka

I don't know! Crash-landing?




The balloon skids along the boiling water, splashing Sokka's hand, which he shakes while blocking his mouth to prevent himself from screaming. The balloon hits the base of the rock, ejecting the two from it.


Zuko

[Looking at the destroyed war balloon.] How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?


Sokka

We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.


Zuko

You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?


Sokka

[Walks to the destroyed balloon.] My dad might be here! I had to come and see!


Zuko

Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy!


Sokka

[Gathers parts from the balloon together.] Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. [After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it into the water.]


Zuko

What are you doing?


Sokka

It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.


Zuko

I hope you know what you're doing. [They both turn to look at the prison.] There's no turning back now.




Morning. Zuko and Sokka have entered the prison, and come out of a supply room filled with reserve guard uniforms. Both of them wear prison guard uniforms.


Zuko

I hope these disguises work.


Sokka

We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.




A series of guards run by. One of them runs back and looks at them.


Male guard

Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on.




The two go to the yard. Prisoners are gathered in a circle as the guards move through to the inside.


Chit Sang

I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell.


Bully guard

[Whips fire at him.] Stop right there, Chit Sang.




Zuko tries to approach, but Sokka grabs his arm to stop him.


Sokka

We can't blow our cover.


Bully guard

I've had it with your unruly behavior!


Chit Sang

What did I do?


Bully guard

He wants to know what he did. [To Zuko and Sokka.] Isn't that cute? [Gives them a look when they say nothing.]


Zuko

Uh, very cute, sir.


Sokka

Super cute.


Bully guard

[Walks up to Chit Sang.] You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang!


Chit Sang

What? That's not a prison rule.


Bully guard

Do it!


Chit Sang

Make me.




The bully guard walks away, but as he is leaving, he whips fire at Chit Sang. Chit Sang blocks it, and redirects it at him. The bully guard breaks the blast with a kick.


Bully guard

Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler. [Pointing at Sokka.] You! Help me take him in.


Sokka

[Whispers to Zuko.] Meet back here in an hour. [Runs up to Chit Sang and the guard.]




Back inside, Chit Sang is led to a cooler.


Bully guard

The warden will deal with you soon. [Sokka closes the doors.] Can you believe this guy?


Sokka

[Playing along.] Prisoners! Am I right?


Bully guard

Ugh. Tell me about it.




Meal time for the guards. Zuko is getting food, noticeably the only guard wearing a helmet.


Male guard

Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax.


Zuko

But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.




The guards laugh.


Female guard

Give it a week, he'll loosen up.


Zuko

Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?


Female guard

[Bluntly.] No, you can't date the female guards.


Male guard

Trust me, you don't want to. [The female guard throws a cup at him, which causes the guard sitting behind him to laugh.]


Zuko

No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right? [The other guards nod.] So what about war prisoners?




In the yard, the warden arrives on the gondolas. Meanwhile, Sokka and the bully guard continue to stand guard by the cooler. Sokka is looking inside at Chit Sang who is shivering.


Sokka

It sure looks cold in there.


Bully guard

That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there. [Notices someone coming; lowers his mask.] It's the warden! [He and Sokka stand to attention.] Look alive!


Warden

[Opens the cooler.] So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.


Chit Sang

I wasn't trying to escape.


Bully guard

He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes. [He is pushed aside by one of the warden's bodyguards.]


Warden

No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering.




Back in the yard. Zuko approaches Sokka, but does not know it is him.


Zuko

Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?


Sokka

[Lifts up his helmet's visor.] Zuko?


Zuko

Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. [Lifts up his visor.] I'm afraid your father's not here.


Sokka

What? Are you sure, did you double-check?


Zuko

Yeah, I'm sure.


Sokka

No. No! [Bangs his fists against the wall in frustration.]


Zuko

I'm really sorry, Sokka.


Sokka

So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again.


Zuko

Ah, [Holds his chin in thought.] what would Uncle say? [Cut to a frog-view as he looks up at the sky.] Sometimes, clouds have two sides, [Walks over to the railing.] a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich! [Close-up of a disinterested Sokka; voice-over.] So ... when life seems hard ... [Sokka glances to the side.] take a bite out of the silver sandwich!




Sokka's eyes widen when he notices something; close-up of his cheerful expression as he gets up. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko while Sokka runs up to grab the railing next to him, excitedly looking down to the yard below.


Sokka

Maybe we haven't failed after all!


Zuko

That's the spirit! [Folds his arms.] I can't believe that worked. [Looks down.] I didn't even know what I was saying.


Sokka

No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... [As he points, the camera shifts to an overhead view of the yard, before rapidly zooming in on a dejected-looking Suki.] It's Suki!




Suki, sitting in the prison yard in prison garb, looks up at hearing the continuous ringing of a bell.


Guard

[Voice-over.] Prisoners, [Suki gets up.] back in your cells!




Cut to a view of the prison yard from ground level as the prisoners start to walk back inside. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko and Sokka. The latter's eyes are now rapidly blinking pink hearts, while Zuko gives him a conspicuous look. Sokka does not pay attention and lowers the visor of his helmet with a smile before dashing out of the scene with a surprised Zuko quicking turning his head and looking after him. Cut to the prisoners' housing area. Camera slowly pans to show a guard mopping the floor and another one doing his rounds. Cut to Suki lying on her bed and staring at the ceiling in sadness. The door to her cell opens and closes, illuminating her face as her eyes turn to the door. Cut to a further off side-shot of Sokka entering Suki's cell.


Suki

[Sits up; aggressively.] What is it? Did I do something wrong?


Sokka

[Crosses arms.] You mean you don't recognize me?


Suki

[Close-up. She averts her eyes; bitterly.] You people all look the same to me.


Sokka

[Frontal shot; smugly.] Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.




Sokka purses his lips and attempts smooching sounds as he leans in to kiss Suki. His lips are suddenly grasped by a hand. The camera switches to the side-shot as Suki violently shoves him against the door. Frontal shot of Sokka as he makes contact with the door, his helm flinging off in the process. He looks bewildered to Suki. Cut to a close-up of Suki, her left arm still stretched out in the move she used to push him away. Her angry expression instantly brightens.


Suki

Sokka! [Runs up to him; cut to a side-view.] It's you!




Suki rushes to pull Sokka into an embrace. Still bewildered, he does not immediately return the gesture. Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, Suki resting her head on his shoulder, and he mellows into the embrace, returning it in all honestly while closing his eyes. Cut to a close-up side-shot of Suki, who is tearing up out of joy.


Sokka

[They both stand up, not releasing each other.] The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?


Suki

No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader.


Sokka

[Places his right hand on her left cheek.] Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.


Suki

[Frontal shot.] I'm so glad [Places her hand over Sokka's on her face and closes her eyes.] to see you Sokka. [Opens them again.] I knew you'd come.




Cut to a side-shot of the now-reunited couple as they gaze lovingly at each other. They release hands, placing them on the other's arms, and lean in to kiss; Suki throws her arms around Sokka's neck. Cut to a close-up frontal shot of Zuko standing guard outside the cell. He suddenly looks to his right. Cut to a further off shot, showing the entire hallway, revealing that the sound that drew Zuko's attention was a guard ascending nearby stairs. He taps on the cell door to get Sokka and Suki's attention. Cut to inside the cell where the couple stops kissing, Sokka casting a suspicious look to the door. Cut back to outside the cell, where the female guard approaches Zuko, who is standing in front of the cell door, his arms crossed behind his back. He turns to her as she pulls up next to him.


Female guard

Excuse me. [Cut to a shot from behind Zuko.] I need to get into that cell.


Zuko

[Shot from over the guard's shoulder.] No, you can't go in there! [Looks at the prison cell; unsure.] The lights are out. [Points at the door.] The prisoner could sneak up on you.


Female guard

[Close-up. Cut to a side-shot; annoyed.] Step aside, fool. [She raises her left arm to push Zuko out of the way, though before she can touch him, he grabs hold of the arm and turns her around, slamming her face first against the door.] Hey, hey, what are you doing?




She turns to retaliate against Zuko's action. Cut to inside the cell, where Zuko's head can be seen through the looking hole as he is slammed against the door. The camera pans down to show Sokka and Suki pushed against the door, looking up in worry. Sokka's expression turns serious as he lowers his gaze and puts on his helmet. Cut to a close-up shot of the guard's right calf as Zuko plants his own leg behind it. Switch to a further off shot. Zuko grabs a hold of the woman's right arm and forces her to bend backward, thus averting her sight from the door that slides open. Sokka quickly exits the cell and shuffles away, his back pressed against the wall. The female guard manages to push Zuko's face up with her left arm, regaining a more leveled pose herself. Cut to a close-up side-shot of her from underneath Zuko's arms as she looks to her right.


Female guard

[Instantly cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, who freezes over.] Guard, help! [He turns to look at the struggle.] I think he's an impostor! [Frontal shot of Sokka, looking unsure.] Arrest him!




Cut to a view of the gondola making its way to the prison. Cut back to inside the prison as the struggle continues.


Female guard

Get him off me and arrest him!


Sokka

[Grabs Zuko and throws him down on the floor.] You're under arrest! [Whispering.] Don't worry, I'll figure it out.




Sokka leads Zuko away, followed by the female guard. Later, Zuko, now in prison garb, is in an isolated room. The door opens, revealing the warden.


Warden

Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here, [Smiles evilly and walks into the cell.] Prince Zuko.


Zuko

[Shocked.] How did you know who I am?


Warden

How could I not? You broke my niece's heart.


Zuko

[Even more shocked.] You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her.


Warden

Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds.


Zuko

[Folds his arms.] So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?


Warden

Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect. [Walks away and shuts the door.]




Outside the cells, Sokka comes down and sees Zuko and Suki mopping floors.


Sokka

Oh, good, you guys have met.


Suki

Actually, we met a long time ago.


Zuko

We did?


Suki

[Somewhat angrily.] Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.


Zuko

[Stops mopping for a second.] Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again.




Zuko and Suki stop mopping and hide from the other guards beside a staircase.


Sokka

So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?


Zuko

Yeah ...


Sokka

So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?


Suki

Just get to the point, Sokka.


Sokka

It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.


Zuko

[Exchanges a worried glance with Suki.] The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?


Sokka

I'm telling you, it'll work. [Flashes back to Sokka walking around the island; voice-over.] I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. [Sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away.] I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. [Fade back to Sokka talking to Zuko and Suki.] And bing-bang-boom, we're home free.


Suki

But how are you going to get the cooler out?


Chit Sang

[From the staircase.] Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? [Jumps down.]


Sokka

[Covering up.] What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.


Zuko

Yeah, you heard wrong.


Chit Sang

I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in.


Zuko

There's nothing to get in on.


Sokka

Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?




Zuko lowers his head and Suki covers her eyes while they both sigh in annoyance. Cut back to Chit Sang.


Chit Sang

[Unconvinced.] Okay, well, I come with you or the warden [Camera pans from a serious-looking Zuko to Suki.] hears about this egg, too.


Suki

[To Sokka.] I guess we have no choice.


Sokka

Okay, you're in. [Handing Zuko a wrench.] Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.


Chit Sang

Oh, I can get you inside.




Cut to a view of the stairs as two guards look down at the prison area. Chit Sang walks out from behind the stairs and stands in a spot. Zuko pretends to be mopping and bumps into Chit Sang.


Chit Sang

Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going! [Shoves Zuko.]


Zuko

Hey, you watch who you're shoving! [He pushes Chit Sang.]


Chit Sang

I think you mean whom I'm shoving!




The two scuffle as the prisoners cheer them on. They break apart and Zuko goes for a punch. Chit Sang throws Zuko onto the floor. 


Sokka

[Approaching. Yelling.] I need backup over here!




Zuko dodges Chit Sang as he tries to elbow him. Zuko blasts fire at Chit Sang.


Male guard

No firebending! [Pointing.] Into the cooler!




Zuko is taken down and escorted away by two guards. Sokka looks at Suki, who is mopping and looks back, as he walks off. Later, Sokka opens the cooler.


Sokka

I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.


Zuko

[Raises his head slightly and releases a small breath of fire to warm himself up.] Yes, I have ... completely. [Reveals all the removed bolts and screws, which makes Sokka smile.]


Sokka

[Lifts his visor; whispering.] I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.


Zuko

Someone's coming! [Takes Sokka into the cooler and closes the door.]


Male guard

Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.


Female guard

Anybody interesting?


Male guard

Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners, [Sokka looks at Zuko with shock and worry.] though I did hear there might be a pirate.


Female guard

No fooling!


Zuko

War prisoners. It could be your father.


Sokka

I know.


Zuko

Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?


Sokka

I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?


Zuko

It's your call, Sokka.




Cut to outside the prison, night time. Suki and Chit Sang are waiting for Sokka and Zuko until they hear them above, rolling the, now detached, cooler down the hill. Suki and Chit Sang move to help.


Chit Sang

Took you guys long enough. [Cut briefly to two other prisoners, a male sitting on a rock, and a female waving.] This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too.


Sokka

Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. [They move the cooler into the water. Cut to Sokka lifting a rock hiding his Water Tribe outfit.]


Zuko

Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance.


Suki

[Approaching.] Your dad?


Sokka

[Turns to Zuko.] If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.


Zuko

No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.


Sokka

[Standing.] That supposed to make me feel better?


Zuko

[Sokka moves away.] Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ...


Sokka

Seriously, not helping.


Zuko

[Grabs Sokka's shoulder.] You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.


Chit Sang

[Standing by the cooler boat.] Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?


Sokka

No. I'm staying. You guys go. [To Suki.] You've been here long enough.


Suki

I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.


Zuko

I'm staying, too.


Chit Sang

Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby. [Pushes the cooler into the lake and jumps in.]


Sokka

We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.




As morning arrives, the cooler holding Chit Sang, his buddy, and his girlfriend is still within the perimeter of the prison. The current escapees are sweating as the cooler slowly floats with the current.


Chit Sang

Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle. [Rips off a piece of the cooler. When he puts the piece of metal in the water, the steaming water splashes on to his hand, causing him to scream loudly.]




A watchman catches notice. Two watchmen hit an alarm bell as the warden approaches.


Warden

Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners! Now!




Many guards appear to lock down the prisoners as we see one guard use a fire whip to control the prisoners. Cut to the outside of the prison walls as the camera pans down to Sokka, Suki, and Zuko.


Sokka

The plan failed! They're caught!




Cut back to the warden near a launcher.


Warden

Get the fugitives and throw them in the cooler!


Male guard #2

[The guard in charge of the steering wheel turns toward the warden.] Uh ... they are in a cooler, sir.


Warden

One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown! We have new prisoners arriving! Everything must be completely secure!




The male guard fires a large ballista bolt, catching hold of the cooler, and drags it back toward the prison.


Sokka

The gondola's moving. [Cut to a side-view of the gondola approaching the prison. Cut to a view of the prison yard as the gondola nears its stop. Cut to Sokka and Suki now in the yard.] This is it. [Cut to the gondola arriving. Cut to Sokka, Zuko and Suki in the yard.] If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing.


Suki

We had to. [Holds Sokka's hand.]


Sokka

Come on, come on ...




Cut to a large man with a tattoo and nose ring comes off the gondola first.


Zuko

Is that him? [Cut to Sokka.]


Sokka

My dad doesn't have a nose ring. [Cut briefly to the gondola as several men step off.] Where is he? [Cut to the gondola briefly as we see one more prisoner exit. Hakoda does not appear.] That's it? That can't be it.


Suki

[Comforting.] I'm sorry, Sokka.


Sokka

Oh, no.


Male guard

Hey, you! Get off the gondola!




Cut to the gondola as Hakoda steps out.


Sokka

[Cut to Sokka, Shocked.] Dad ...




Fade to the words "TO BE CONTINUED ..." followed by the credits.



The episode opens to morning at the Boiling Rock, where an overhead shot of the volcano is seen. Cut to view from some point in the boiling water, where the stronghold lies ahead. Cut to view of the warden walking forward, toward the camera.


Guard

Line 'em up for the warden!




Cut to an overhead shot of the perimeter on which they are standing, the warden's back facing the camera. Eight prisoners are seen filing in line, one next to the other, including Hakoda. Cut to the end of the line of prisoners where the last of them line up, the camera zooming out to show Hakoda, who stands at the very end of the line on the right side. Cut to Sokka, who walks forward and lifts his guard mask.


Sokka

Dad ... [Exiting a stairway and passing through a lineup of guards, surprising them a bit.] Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. [Points in the warden's direction.] Sorry!




Cut to overhead shot of the perimeter, the prisoners lined up toward the right and the guards to the left of the screen. Sokka is seen inching his way behind several guards, taller than him. The warden approaches the new prisoners.


Warden

[Walking past the line of prisoners starting from the left.] Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say. [He stops in front of Hakoda who looks downward; looks closer at Hakoda.] Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.


Hakoda

[Averting his gaze slightly off to the side; firmly.] No.


Warden

Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes? [Angrily.] Then take a look!




He raises his left leg and drags Hakoda by his handcuffs down onto the floor. Cut to a side-view of Hakoda kneeling over, his face expressing anger. Cut to Sokka standing behind two guards as he gasps in horror. Cut to shot from below Hakoda, where the warden stands over him, keeping his foot firmly pressed on the warrior's handcuffs.


Warden

I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed. [Cut to the warden's face.] But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye!




Hakoda reluctantly lifts his head to look the warden in the eye and glares hatefully at him.


Warden

[Calmer.] See, isn't that better? [To the other prisoners.] You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all-




He begins to walk forward only for Hakoda to lift his left handcuff slightly, tripping the warden and causing him to fall flat on the ground. Sokka stifles a chuckle, as the two guards he was standing behind rush to aid the warden.


Guard

[Standing over him.] Are you okay, sir?


Warden

[Rises and snaps angrily.] I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!




He storms away impatiently. The two guards look at each other. Cut to wide-view of the perimeter where the prisoners file one behind the other and are led down a stairwell into what is presumed to be the prison hold. Sokka runs away off-screen. Cut to inside the prison, followed by an overhead shot of inside Hakoda's cell, where he sits on his mattress, his face buried in his arms. A sliver of light appears as the doorway to the cell is opened. Hakoda raises his head to see who has entered. Cut to side-view of the entire cell, revealing that Sokka has walked in, still dressed as a guard.


Sokka

[Approaches his father.] Thank goodness you're okay.


Hakoda

[Rises to his feet and extends his right arm out, clenched in a fist, not realizing the guard is his son in disguise; Sokka backs up a bit.] If you take one step closer, you'll see just how "okay" I am.


Sokka

[Lifting up his helmet mask.] Dad, it's me.


Hakoda

[Softens up and grows teary-eyed.] Sokka, [The two embrace; Sokka drops his helmet to the floor.] my son. [Amused.] You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.


Sokka

[Rubs the back of his neck sheepishly.] Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.




Cut to a dimly-lit corridor. Cut to view of a door as it slides open, revealing Chit Sang sitting inside an interrogation room, cuffed to a wooden chair. The warden walks on-screen into the room. Cut to an overhead shot of the interrogation room as he approaches the prisoner.


Warden

[Calmly.] Are you comfortable, Chit Sang?


Chit Sang

[Snaps.] If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it! [The warden appears behind him.] I'm not a squealer!


Warden

[Cuts to close-up of his face; casually.] Chit Sang, I only asked if you were comfortable.


Chit Sang

[Brightly.] Well, yeah, actually I am pretty comfortable.




The warden, in a fit of anger, kicks the chair to the ground. Chit Sang falls forward off screen. Cuts to shot of him lying on the floor, still bound to the chair, his face pressed against the ground. The warden walks up to Chit Sang.


Warden

Are you still comfortable?


Chit Sang

No.


Warden

I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. So you're gonna tell me ... [Leans in closer to Chit Sang.] who is?




The warden exits the room. Cut to view of the room, as the two guards hoist the chair upward and set it on the ground. The guard on Chit Sang's left walks over to the doorway and slides the door to the cell closed. Cut to shot of the prison courtyard. Cut to shot of outside Hakoda's cell where Sokka can be seen looking through the open slit in the cell door, averting his eyes in different directions.


Sokka

[To Hakoda.] So where's Bato? [Cut to inside the prison cell; Sokka turns away from the door.] Where's everyone else from the invasion?


Hakoda

The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. [Sokka comes by his father and sits down.] But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters?


Sokka

[Smiles.] You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?


Hakoda

That's right.


Sokka

Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.


Hakoda

[Lays a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Good. We'll need all the help we can get.


Sokka

And you know Prince Zuko?


Hakoda

The son of the Fire Lord? I don't know him, but I know of him.


Sokka

Well, he's here too.


Hakoda

[Crosses his arms angrily.] Sounds like a major problem.


Sokka

Actually, he's on our side now. [Cut to Hakoda, who gives his son a suspicious look.] I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help. [Hakoda nods his head at Sokka, indicating that he understands.]


Hakoda

So, do you have a plan?


Sokka

[Downcast.] We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. [Leans forward and rests his face in his arms.] I dunno if there's another way off this island.


Hakoda

[Smiles and pats a hand on Sokka's back.] Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.


Sokka

Then we'd better find two.




Hakoda laughs. Sokka chuckles nervously. Cut to a ground level shot of inside the prison hold. Sokka approaches a cell door and averts his gaze alertly. He lifts his helmet mask and peers into the slit of a cell doorway.


Sokka

[In a hushed voice.] Zuko, are you there?


Zuko

[A view of Zuko's eyes appears in the slit from inside the cell.] I'm here.


Sokka

I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.


Male guard

[Off-camera; startles Sokka.] What are you doing here?




Sokka turns around, pulling down his helmet mask. The camera shifts to reveal two guards standing on the stairwell behind him. Cut to shot from in between the two guards.


Sokka

[Pointing to the cell and trying to act gruff.] I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!


Male guard

Well, you'll have to do that later. He's coming with us.


Sokka

[Puzzled.] Why?


Female guard

[Irritated.] Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why!


Sokka

Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? [Punches his palm with his fist.]


Female guard

Fine, ten seconds.




The two guards fold their arms. Sokka enters the cell and begins to "rough up" Zuko. The female guard leans against the wall, crosses her arms and shakes her head in mock disapproval.


Sokka

[Off-camera from inside the cell.] Take that ... and this! [Punching noises come from the cell.]


Male guard

[Amused.] Newbie.




Cut to shot of a bundled-up mattress being held up, several blows being landed to it. Cut to shot of the cell where Sokka is seen punching the mattress which Zuko holds up, the two faking the entire scenario. Zuko shouts a few times in mock pain.


Sokka

[In a hushed voice while still punching the mattress.] We have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction. [Cuts to shot of Zuko who peers from behind the blanket; off camera.] Be in the yard in one hour.




A sliver of light appears as the cell door is opened. Sokka suddenly grabs Zuko and begins to wrestle him to look convincing as the two guards enter.


Male guard

[Separates the two.] All right, that's enough.




Zuko is escorted out of the cell by the guards while Sokka remains behind. Cut to an overhead shot of a hallway, the camera shifting downward to show Zuko being dragged.


Zuko

[Voice-over.] What are you doing? Where are you taking me? [He is thrown into a chair in an interrogation room.] I didn't do anything wrong!


Mai

Come on, [Zuko looks to the source of the voice.] Zuko. [Emerges from the corner of the room; annoyed.] We all know that's a lie.


Zuko

[Shocked.] Mai!




Cut to shot of the entire cell, Zuko still sitting on the floor with Mai standing over him. The cell door is open, with at least one guard patrolling it from outside. Cut to view of prison hold before switching to an upside-down shot of the warden sliding open another cell door and entering the room.


Warden

How is he?




Cut to right-side up shot of the two guards holding Chit Sang upside-down in the chair. Chit Sang's face is red and strained.


Male guard #2

I think he's ready to talk.




They toss chair the chair forward toward the warden back to a normal position. Chit Sang inhales deeply a few times, his face slowly returning to normal color, sweat dripping down his face.


Warden

[Approaches him from behind.] Have you had enough time to think about what I asked?


Chit Sang

Yes.


Warden

[Eager.] And?


Chit Sang

You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.


Warden

[Places his hand on Chit Sang's shoulder.] Who?


Chit Sang

It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard. Only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.




The warden smiles slyly, pats Chit Sang on the head, and exits. The camera focuses on Chit Sang, who maintains a cold-hard expression. The scene changes to the prison cell where Zuko sits in the chair slumped over and Mai stands over him.


Zuko

How did you know I was here?


Mai

Because I know you so well.


Zuko

But, how-


Mai

The warden's my uncle, you idiot. [Zuko sighs; Mai shows him a letter.] The truth is, I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.


Zuko

I didn't mean to -


Mai

You didn't mean to? [Reading the letter.] "Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving."


Zuko

Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation!


Mai

[Sarcastically.] Thanks Zuko, that makes me feel all better. [Throws the letter at him.]


Zuko

[Stands up.] Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country.


Mai

Save it? You're betraying your country!


Zuko

That's not how I see it.




Cut back to Mai who looks away from him sulkily and folds her arms. Cut to Suki's cell, where she is practicing her fighting moves. Sokka enters.


Suki

Sokka, what's going on?


Sokka

[Places his hand on her shoulder.] I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. [Walks over to the door and peers outside.] I just talked to my dad.


Suki

That's great.


Sokka

Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.


Suki

What?


Sokka

My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola [Puts both hands on her shoulders.] and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.


Suki

[Takes his hands off her shoulders.] We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.


Sokka

My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.


Suki

Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.


Sokka

Not if the warden is the captive. [Nearby noise occurs. Moves to look outside.] I have to go. [Suki hugs him.] I'll find you before we start the riot. [Cut to outside the cell, where he slides out of the cell.]


Male guard

Hey, you, the warden wants to see you!


Sokka

Why?


Male guard

I don't know, I didn't ask.


Sokka

Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? [Walks off-screen.]


Male guard

He wants to see you ... now. [Sokka is escorted by two guards.]




Scene moves to the yard with a line-up of guards, the warden, and Chit Sang present.


Warden

Put him in the line-up.




They throw Sokka in the line-up with a bunch of other guards, now with no helmet like the rest of them. He tries hiding behind a lowly guard, but the guard pushes him away.


Warden

One of you is an impostor who thought he could fool me. [Chit Sang steps forward.] But now, that person is going to be in a lot of trouble. Who is it?




Sokka's teeth start chattering, clearly nervous among the other calm guards. The camera stays on Sokka, who closes his eyes.


Chit Sang

[Off-screen.] That's him, warden. He's the impostor! [The camera shifts to Chit Sang, who is pointing at the bully guard.]


Bully guard

What?




Cut to the warden, who smiles evilly and walks away.


Bully guard

[Grabs Chit Sang by the shirt.] I am not! [Chit Sang just raises his hands nonchalantly in defense.] He's lying! [Another guard grabs him.] He's a liar!




The guard is taken away. Chit Sang turns and smiles slyly at Sokka, who looks on and breathes a sigh of relief.
Cut to a window. The camera pans down to the bully guard in an interrogation room surrounded by two guards. The warden stands in front of and away Chit Sang, holding his hands behind his back.



Bully guard

I'm telling you ... it wasn't me!


Warden

Save your breath! I know you were working together. [Turns around and moves in closer to the guard.] You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.


Bully guard

That was just a coincidence!




The door opens, someone enters.


Male guard #3

Sir, there's someone to see you.


Warden

[Angrily.] Who told you to interrupt me?




The warden turns angrily toward the door, but looks shocked and bows upon seeing who it is. Cut to show Azula standing at the door with Ty Lee behind her. All of the guards bow to her as well.


Azula

I did.


Warden

[Cut closer to Azula.] Princess Azula. [Azula and Ty Lee walk in.] Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. [Stands up.] I didn't realize you were coming.


Azula

[Walks in and notices the guard sitting in the chair.] Who is this?


Warden

[Cut to the bully guard, who looks away.] He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.


Bully guard

[Desperately.] It wasn't me!


Warden

[Angrily.] Quiet, you!


Azula

[Crossing her arms.] You're wasting your time. That's not one of them. [Turns and starts to leave.]




The warden turns and looking surprised, and confused, looks from Azula to the guard before looking back to Azula again.


Warden

How do you know?


Azula

[Smiles sinisterly; quietly.] Because I'm a people person. [Exits.]




In the hall, Sokka approaches a guard in charge of the cell doors.


Sokka

Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.


Door guard

But we're in the middle of a lockdown.


Sokka

Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that. [Walks off-screen; the guard raises his mask and looks at him speechless.] I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. [Guard grows more nervous. Walks back on-screen, lifting his helmet mask.] What's your name again?


Door guard

[Starts to sweat; horrified.] Wait! Don't tell the warden. I'm just a little confused.


Sokka

Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. [Places his arm around the guard's shoulder.]


Door guard

Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out!




The guard opens all the doors by pulling the levers. The prisoners head for the yard. The prisoners mingle in the yard, where Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda meet.


Sokka

This is it! We have to start a riot.


Suki

Okay. But how do we do that?


Hakoda

[Smiles smugly.] I'll show you. [Shoves a prisoner.]


Tough prisoner

Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings.


Hakoda

Aren't you mad at me?


Tough prisoner

Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger.


Sokka

This isn't working.




Suddenly, Chit Sang appears behind Sokka and puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder.


Chit Sang

Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out, [Smiles.] but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in.


Sokka

[Gets an idea.] Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. [Points to him.] You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?


Chit Sang

A prison riot? Please. [Grabs a prisoner and lifts him in the air, bouncing him up and down.] Hey! [All the prisoners look at him.] Riot!




The riot begins. Several blasts of fire go off.


Hakoda

[Looks shocked for a moment.] Impressive.


Tough prisoner

Forget about controlling my anger ... [Raises his arms.] let's riot! [He is taken down by another prisoner. The riot is in full swing. Cut the floor of the yard as chaos and dust ensues everywhere. Cut to a prisoner sitting on another prisoner's shoulders, attempting to choke him. Cut to the bottom of a tower as various guards look down at the scene.]


Warden

Who let these prisoners into the yard? [Cut to the warden on a balcony.] This is supposed to be a lockdown!




The door guard, who was in charge of the control room, raises his visor and looks at the warden, horrified. He puts his back against the wall and sneaks away by quickly tip-toeing and ducks to a corner. The camera cuts back to Zuko and Mai.


Male guard

Ma'am, there's a riot going on! I'm here to protect you!


Mai

I don't need any protection.


Zuko

[Gives a slight chuckle; proudly.] Believe me, she doesn't.


Male guard

I'm sorry, but I'm under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens. [Zuko gives a serious look.]




Zuko blasts fire at the guard and starts to run toward the door. The guard jumps in front of Mai to shield her.


Mai

Get off of me! [She throws the guard away from her and chases Zuko.]




Exiting, Zuko closes and locks the door, trapping Mai and the guard in the room. He looks at Mai through the slit in the door with regret, while she stares back in anger, before running off to join his friends. Back in the yard, he reaches everyone else and slams down another guard as the riot continues.


Sokka

Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!


Zuko

And how do we do that?


Sokka

I'm not sure.


Zuko

[Groans.] I thought you thought this through!


Sokka

I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!


Zuko

Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important! [Rubs his forehead.]


Chit Sang

Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.




Sokka peeks out and looks amazed as he sees Suki hop up on the heads of the rioters before jumping and flipping onto the tower. She easily defeats the first guard with a few quick jabs. Two more guards arrive. She ducks a fire blast and sweeps the first one, promptly dodges the second one's fire blast, and continues to climb the tower. She makes it up to the top and defeats the final guard with a sliding kick. She soon grabs the warden, threatening him with her fist in front of his face.


Warden

You wouldn't dare.


Suki

[Ties his hands together and uses his headband as a gag.] Sorry, warden. You're my prisoner now. [Slams the warden against the wall; the rest of the escapees arrive.] We've got the warden! Now let's get out of here!




Everyone else is out of breath.


Hakoda

That's some girl.


Sokka

[Proudly.] Tell me about it.




Cut to the roof as they all make the run to the gondola.


Suki

We're almost there!




They are stopped by guards who launch two fire blasts at them. Zuko shoves Sokka out of the way and blocks the two fire blasts. More guards appear to help.


Zuko

Back off! We've got the warden! [The guards see the warden on Chit Sang's shoulder, bound and gagged, and clear the way.] Let's go!




They continue along their path, cautiously watching the guards so they do not try any sudden moves. They arrive at the gondola. Suki opens the door.


Suki

Everyone in!




Zuko starts the gondola and kicks the handle a few times attempting to break it. He sees the guards rushing toward him and kicks the handle again and breaks it. He jumps toward the gondola while dodging guards fire blasts. Sokka grabs Zuko's hand and helps him into the gondola.


Sokka

What are you doing?


Zuko

I'm making it so they can't stop us.


Sokka

Way to think ahead.


Suki

We're on our way!


Hakoda

Wait! Who's that?




Azula and Ty Lee stand at the bottom of the gondola station. All the guards bow down.


Zuko

That's a problem. It's my sister and her friend.




Ty Lee leaps up and climbs the line. Azula takes a pair of handcuffs from a guard. After elevating herself to the line with a fire blast, she uses the cuffs to attach herself to the line, and blasts up it. The occupants of the gondola watch as they approach.


Suki

[Determined.] This is a rematch I've been waiting for.


Zuko

Me too.




Sokka, Suki, and Zuko climb to the top of the gondola to meet Azula and Ty Lee. Ty Lee flips into the air and lands in front of Suki, who assumes a battle-ready position. Azula pulls herself up onto the roof and faces Zuko and Sokka. Without warning, Azula blasts fire, but Zuko blocks it. Ty Lee and Suki trade blows at one another, but neither can land. Ty Lee is forced to the edge but jumps into the gondola and comes out the other side, continuing her attacks. Zuko continues to wipe out Azula's fire blasts. Sokka draws her back to the edge with his sword. Zuko goes in for a finish, but Azula dodges Zuko's blast and stays on the gondola. She counters with a blast that goes wide, almost striking Suki and Ty Lee, who barely manage to dodge it. Meanwhile, the warden attempts to free himself while the other prisoners are distracted. A male guard watches from a telescope.


Male guard

There's the warden! I see him!


Warden

[Frees himself and runs to look out of the gondola.] Cut the line! [Chit Sang notices and grabs the warden.]


Male guard

He wants us to cut the line.


Male guard #2

But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive!


Male guard #3

[Puts down his telescope.] He knows that.




The guards stop the gondola by jamming the mechanism with metal bars; the wheel screeches as it grinds to a halt. The gondola rocks back and forth from the sudden stop, disrupting the combatants from their respective duels. Losing his balance, Sokka slides to the edge of the gondola, but Zuko pulls him in at the last moment. Ty Lee jumps up to the top of the wire to see what is happening.


Ty Lee

They're about to cut the line!




The guards work to cut the line. Azula notices another gondola approaching on the other wire, heading inbound.


Azula

[Smirks.] Then it's time to leave. [Blasts herself up.] Goodbye, Zuko. [Reaches the other gondola.]




Ty Lee backflips to the other gondola. When she reaches it, she looks back at Sokka, Suki, and Zuko with concern. The other three jump back into the gondola.


Zuko

They're cutting the line! The gondola's about to go!


Hakoda

I hope this thing floats.




Pan down to the Boiling Lake. The line is almost entirely severed by now, but before the guards can finish the job, they are pinned to a metal wall by stilettos.


Male guard

What are you doing?




The camera cuts to show Mai standing near the line.


Mai

Saving the jerk who dumped me.




Other guards try to attack Mai, but she pins them all down with her knives. She releases the block on the line, allowing the gondola to continue in motion. Everyone looks back to see what happened.


Sokka

Who's that?




Mai continues to fight off guards and turns her head to see the others.


Zuko

[Shocked.] It's Mai!


Azula

[Angrily.] What is she doing?




Ty Lee shrugs and makes a small sound as they watch her continue to fight off guards. The gondola makes it to the top of the hill. Everyone leaves. Chit Sang holds the warden and throws him back in when Hakoda points at it.


Hakoda

Sorry, warden. Your record is officially broken. [The warden struggles against his bindings.]




Cut to the others escaping over the rim of the volcano.


Suki

Well, we made it out. Now what?




Sokka turns and notices Zuko standing still.


Sokka

Zuko, what are you doing?


Zuko

My sister was on that island.


Sokka

Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!


Zuko

What I mean is she must have come here somehow. [Walks up to a large hill by the sea.] There! [Pan down to a large airship.] That's our way out of here!




Back at the prison. Mai is detained by two guards, while Azula glares at her. Ty Lee stands on Azula's side, looking terrified and concerned at the two.


Azula

Leave us alone. [The guards give the Fire Nation salute and exit.] I never expected this from you. [Cut briefly to a worried Ty Lee before switching back to Azula.] The thing I don't understand is "Why?". Why would you do it? You know the consequences.


Mai

I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.


Azula

[Enraged.] No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!




Azula makes the motion to create lightning, and Mai pulls out one of her stilettos. Before Azula can complete her attack, however, she is struck twice by Ty Lee and falls down, paralyzed by her friend's chi blocking.


Ty Lee

[Runs to a shocked Mai, shaking her from her stupor.] Come on! Let's get out of here!




Mai and Ty Lee are quickly surrounded by guards and captured.


Azula

[Still on the ground; angrily.] You're both fools! [She's helped up by two guards.]


Male guard

What shall we do with them, princess?


Azula

Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!




Nightfall, Western Air Temple. The ship is returned. Zuko and Sokka exit, standing in front of Toph, Aang, and Katara.


Katara

What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?


Zuko

It kind of got destroyed.


Aang

Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.


Toph

Did you at least get some good meat?


Sokka

I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.




Suki, Hakoda, and Chit Sang exit.


Chit Sang

[Waving.] I'm new. What's up, everybody?


Katara

[Tearing up; overjoyed.] Dad? [Runs to him.]


Hakoda

Hi, Katara. [They embrace.]


Katara

How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?


Sokka

We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.




Hakoda pulls Sokka into the embrace. The camera pans away from the scene.


Toph

Seriously? You guys didn't find any meat?




Fade to credits.
