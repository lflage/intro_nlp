The episode opens to under the water. The camera pans upward to sea level, and higher up into the city. The scene changes to where Katara is set to spar with a young boy named Sangok. She eyes her opponent with a look of determination. Sangok looks at her with a frightened expression on his face, shaking slightly. He summons a globule of water, freezes it into an iceball, and fires it at her. Katara, however, is quick to melt the iceball and, turning around swiftly, bends a wave of water at him, which she proceeds to freeze, thus suspending Sangok in an icy trap.


Pakku

[Displeased.] Nice try, Pupil Sangok. [Shows Sangok trying to break free.] A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge. [He unfreezes the ice; Sangok falls to the ground dazed.] Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara? [The scene cuts to several students sitting by the sidelines, the camera panning to the right showing all of them to be tired and unamused.] Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained. [Cuts to a shot of Katara, who smiles brightly.] You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything. [Turns to Aang irritably.] Raw talent alone is not enough. [Cut to Aang who is lying on the ground with a lazy smile, floating Momo around on an airball above him.] Pupil Aang!


Aang

[Stops bending at the sound of his name; Momo lands on his head.] Yes, Master Pakku?


Pakku

[Sarcastically.] Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending.


Aang

[Jumps off the ground with airbending.] I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out.




He twists around, bending some snow around him to make a snowman of himself, which Momo knocks over. Cut to Pakku and Katara who wear similar expressions of disdain. Pakku shakes his head in disappointment, while Katara looks on in irritation. The scene changes to another part of the city where Sokka and Yue are taking a walk along a bridge. Sokka is walking along the top of bridge's wall while balancing.


Yue

So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?


Sokka

[Sitting down on the ledge.] Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.


Yue

[Laughs and places her hand on Sokka's shoulder; when Sokka smiles at her, she gets a little upset and looks at him seriously.] Sokka, this is wrong.


Sokka

[Protesting.] What's wrong? We're taking a walk!


Yue

[Unsurely.] I'm engaged. It just feels ...


Sokka

[Brightens.] I know what you need. [He hops off the rail to stand by her side.] You need to meet my good friend, Appa.


Yue

[Curiously.] Who?




The scene changes to where the two approach the stables, where Appa is resting.


Sokka

[Opening his arms out in enthusiasm.] Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? [The thunder of Appa's shifting bulk is heard and Sokka's features turn to surprise. Appa enters from the left and lands on top of him and licks him, much to Sokka's dismay.] Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up!


Yue

Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention!




Yue laughs. Sokka attempts to pull himself free of Appa, who continues to lick his face. The scene changes to the two sitting on Appa's saddle, Sokka holding the reins in his hand.


Yue

[Excitedly.] So, how does this work?


Sokka

You holding on tight? [Yue nods; in a cool tone.] Yip ... [Cut to a close up of Sokka's face.] yip.




The camera zooms out to a shot of the entire city as Appa takes off.


Yue

[Impressed.] Oh ... my ... goodness! [Cuts to where Appa is soaring over the ocean; Yue is looking over the saddle.] Wow, I can't believe you do this every day.


Sokka

[Stretches.] Yeah, we pretty much live up here.


Yue

Is it always this cold in the sky? [Moves closer to Sokka.]


Sokka

[Happily.] Not when you're with someone.


Yue

[Turning to face Sokka, blushing.] It's beautiful up here.


Sokka

Yeah ... [The two turn to each other and slowly begin to lean in, but at the very last moment, Sokka widens his eyes, turns away and pretends to act cool again.] Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. [Snow and black soot start to fall from the sky.] Hey, look!


Yue

[Camera zooms out to Appa flying through the gray snowfall; worried.] What's happening?


Sokka

[Nervous.] Oh no ...




The scene cuts to where civilians have stopped to observe the sooty snow. Cuts to Aang, who laughs as he gleefully rolls around in the snow in a circular pattern. Cuts to Momo, who opens his mouth and catches a sooty snowflake only to bristle and spit out the contents. Aang stops playing around and looks up at the snowfall with a concerned face. Cuts to civilians standing near a fountain. Camera pans down to show the fountain's water turning black.


Sokka

[Picking up handful of black snow.] Soot.


Yue

What?




Scene reveals Sokka, Yue, and Appa having landed right outside the outskirts of the city, near the shores of the North Pole seas. Sokka is kneeling down, observing the snow.


Sokka

I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow. [Rises.]


Yue

But, why?


Sokka

[Looking out over the horizon.] It's the Fire Nation. [Looks at Yue concerned.] They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, [Camera zooms out to show the enormity of the sooty snowfall.] I'd say there's a lot of them.




Cuts to the lead ship sailing toward the Water Tribe, under the command of Admiral Zhao and Iroh.


Zhao

[Voice-over.] This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh. [Cuts to Zhao and Iroh standing on deck.] Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.


Iroh

[Tersely.] Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.


Zhao

I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se. [Walks forward.]


Iroh

[Sadly.] I hope not, for your sake.


Zhao

Tell the captains to prepare for first strike.




Iroh walks away. Cuts to the bow of the lead ship breaking through thick ice floes floating in the water. Cuts to the interior of the ship, where Iroh is confronting Zuko disguised as a Fire Nation soldier. Zuko is forced to wear the disguise to keep the secret from Zhao that he survived an attempted assassination.


Iroh

[Secretly.] We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?


Zuko

[Removes face covering to reveal his face covered in cuts.] I'm working on it, Uncle. [Puts covering back in place.]




The two head off in separate directions. Back at the Northern Water Tribe, citizens flee to the town hall, as two watchmen hit a drum to signal the Fire Nation's approach. Sokka and Yue make their way up the steps, but Yue stops the approach.


Sokka

[Trying to drag her along.] What's wrong? [Pointing up to the citadel.] We have to go!


Yue

[Sadly; lets go of Sokka's hand.] No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all.


Sokka

[Protesting.] What? We're just friends.


Yue

I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else! [Turns away sorrowfully.]


Sokka

You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.


Yue

But I do love my people.


Sokka

[Objecting.] You're not marrying them.


Yue

[Turns to face Sokka.] You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye.




She runs past Sokka up the stairs quickly. Closes up on Sokka, who looks on with dismay. The scene cuts to inside the chief's Royal Palace.


Arnook

The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe, [While saying this line, the scene flashes from Yue to Pakku to Hahn.] but they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us! I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.


Sokka

[Rising from his seat.] Count me in!


Katara

Sokka ...


Arnook

Be warned, many of you will not return. [Several Water Tribe men rise and walk forward.] Come forward to receive my mark, if you accept the task.




Arnook paints three red line marks with his fingers on one man's forehead. The man walks away, slightly sorrowful. Sokka steps forward and Arnook paints the same three marks. He begins walking away sadly and turns to look at Yue. After staring at each other for a few moments, Sokka continues walking. Yue averts her gaze, closes her eyes and begins crying.
The scene changes to outside the city where Aang is perched on a snow mound, holding his staff. Arnook approaches him.



Arnook

The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread.




Katara joins them.


Aang

I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. [Determined.] I'm going to make a difference this time.




He rises and holds his staff behind his back in a similar pose as seen in the opening sequence. The camera pans upward to the sky. The scene changes to where Aang, Katara, Sokka, Appa and all the warriors are gathered at the wall. Something distant can be seen soaring toward the city from the horizon. Aang squints his eyes before realizing the object is a fireball. Cuts to Sokka and Katara, who look on in terror. The fireball collides into the wall of the city, sending Team Avatar and several warriors flying back. Cuts to the wall of the city, damaged and beginning to fall apart.
Cuts to another fireball being launched into the air. The fireball disintegrates a bridge within the city. Cuts to a trebuchet operator launching another fireball into the air, which hits the wall.



Aang

Yip-yip!




He and Appa take flight, heading toward the fleet. Cuts to the warriors who regather themselves, helping each other up.


Sokka

[Pulls his arm free from the snow.] Katara!




Katara uses waterbending to free herself from a snow mound she became buried underneath. Sokka smiles and hoists his sister onto her feet. The two cast their eyes upward, catching sight of two fireballs that soar overhead. Cuts to Appa who grunts, Aang guiding him, a determined look on his face. Cuts to bird's-eyes view of the ocean, Aang flying toward a single Fire Navy ship. Two fireballs are launched. Cuts to the deck of the ship, where trebuchet operators launch another fireball back to Appa and Aang. Cuts to fireball soaring straight toward Aang, who uses his glider to direct it into an icy cliff side near the city.


Aang

I'll take it from here, boy.




He jumps down from Appa and flies downward on his glider onto the first ship. Using airbending, he sweeps several trebuchet operators off their feet and leaps onto one trebuchet. An operator comes forward and slams a sledgehammer onto the machine, nearly striking Aang who manages to back-flip away. Cuts to where he stands on top of the contraption, two more operators approaching him from opposite directions, each holding a sledgehammer. The one on his right brings the sledgehammer down proceeded by the one on his left. He jumps into the air, avoiding both blows and completely collapses the trebuchet with his glider and the use of airbending. He lands onto the deck, triumphant.
He runs over to an unoccupied trebuchet, already loaded with a flaming boulder. He sticks a sledgehammer in another launcher's chain. When a soldier approaches him, Aang blasts him away, activating the catapult which launches the fireball straight into the deck, leaving a large hole. The camera zooms out on the damage.
Cuts to Aang, who runs past two operators who quickly chase after him. He arrives at two trebuchets, one before him and one behind him, and tangles their chains together. He leaps onto the machine before him as the soldiers approach and slams his foot onto the pedal that activates the catapult. The catapult lunges forward, causing the second trebuchet to collide into the first, destroying both.
Smiling happily, Aang proceeds to another machine. Cuts to a burly man, who observes him evilly. Aang prepares to strike the machine with a sledgehammer only to turn around and catch sight of the man who attempts to land blows from afar with two sledgehammers, each attached to long chains. Aang jumps out of the way of several blows. Cuts to the man who swings the chains around. Aang leans against a beam only for the two chains to wrap around the beam thus trapping him. He struggles to break free.
Cuts to the soldier, who is suddenly knocked over by Appa's paw. The chains snap and Aang breaks free.



Aang

[Brightening.] Appa!




Appa leans over the deck of the ship and tosses the man overboard before turning to Aang, who runs over and embraces him.


Aang

Thanks for the rescue, buddy!




His expression of relief becomes one of alarm when the ship begins to rumble. Cuts to an undamaged trebuchet that collapses when a gigantic spike of ice pierces straight through the hull and deck of the ship. Cuts to dozens of Water Tribe warriors riding on boats, who are using waterbending to suspend the ship. Cuts to the entire ship being uprooted. Cuts to Appa, who stands on the sloping deck, the ruins of machinery sliding downward past them. He and Aang take off. Cuts to the horizon, where an entire fleet comes into view, the ships large in quantity.


Aang

[Shocked.] You've got to be kidding me ...




The scene cuts to the training for the mission.


Arnook

Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms.




The camera pans upward, revealing a young man, Hahn, who appears in the uniform that will be used. Sokka laughs. The rest of the warriors turn to stare at him.


Hahn

[Angrily.] What's your problem?


Sokka

Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.


Hahn

[Irritably.] Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.


Sokka

[Sarcastically.] When, like, a hundred years ago?


Arnook

Eighty-five.


Sokka

[Walks over and flings one of the shoulder spikes with his finger.] The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.




Sokka bends the tip of one of the shoulder spikes back with the tip of his finger and lets go. It bounces back to its original shape with a little comic sound effect.


Hahn

How do we know we can trust this guy? [Turns to growl at Sokka, who glares at him in return.] Such bold talk for a new recruit.


Arnook

Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn. He's a capable warrior and I value his input. [Sokka shoots Hahn a smug look; Arnook turns to the rest of the regiment.] Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer.


Sokka

His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, [Tracing imaginary sideburns with his fingers.] big sideburns, bigger temper ...


Arnook

Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. [Beginning to walk away.] I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law.


Sokka

[Stares at Hahn, mouth agape; points at him and narrows his eyes.] Princess Yue's marrying you?


Hahn

[Irritated.] Yeah, what of it?


Sokka

[Turns away from Hahn, upset.] Nothing. Congratulations.




Scene fades to sunset where fireballs are continually launched. A bird's-eye view is shown of the fleet attacking the city. Cuts to several fireballs; camera pans downward to show them hitting the city.


Pakku

[Pointing to the sky.] Stop those fireballs!




Cuts to shot of oncoming fireball. The waterbenders bend up a column of water and freeze it, capturing the fireball. Cuts to side-view of the leading ships of the fleet, the uprooted ship in view. The scene cuts to the interior of Zhao's ship.


Iroh

It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. [Cuts to shot of the ship, sailing past a rising moon.] The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. [Cuts back to Iroh and Zhao.]


Zhao

Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is.




The lead ship drops its anchor, followed by the rest of the ships, who drop their anchors and cease the attack. Cuts to a shot of the city, smoke billowing from several spots. Yue can be seen looking out over the horizon.


Yue

They've stopped firing.




Yue and Katara stand side by side, viewing the city. Appa appears over the horizon, flying toward them.


Katara

Aang!




Aang lands on the ground, exasperated. Katara and Yue approach him.


Aang

[Clearly exhausted, placing his hands on his head.] I can't do it ... I can't do it.


Katara

What happened?


Aang

[Dimly.] I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.


Yue

[Pleadingly.] But, you have to. You're the Avatar.


Aang

[Solemnly.] I'm just one kid.




He buries his face in his arms. Katara kneels down beside him in an attempt to comfort him. The scene changes to nightfall on the lead ship. Cuts inside a room where Zuko prepares a boat, winding up some rope. Iroh enters.


Iroh

If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.


Zuko

I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.


Iroh

I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, [Voice breaking slightly.] ever since I lost my son ...


Zuko

Uncle, you don't have to say it.


Iroh

... I think of you as my own.


Zuko

[Faces his uncle, a softer expression on his face.] I know, Uncle. We'll meet again. [Iroh hugs him.] After I have the Avatar. [He turns away and gets on the boat.]


Iroh

Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.


Zuko

I will. [Lowers the boat, suspended by ropes, down the side of the ship into the water.]


Iroh

And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!


Zuko

I'll be fine!




The shot cuts to the city, several ships lying stationery ahead of him. Back inside the warriors' base. Hahn and Sokka sharpen their axes against grindstones.


Hahn

[Smugly.] Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks.


Sokka

[Annoyed.] Perks? What does that mean?


Hahn

I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either.


Sokka

[Angered.] Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!


Hahn

[Camera begins closing up on Hahn.] Whoa, hang on. What do you care? [Sokka closes his eyes sorrowfully.] You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? [Smirking.] No offense.


Sokka

[Shouts and tackles Hahn; the two begin rolling around on the floor in a struggle.] You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense!




The two continue to roll about on the floor. Cuts to a shot of Sokka and Hahn, each pulling the other's ponytail in fury. They are suddenly separated by Arnook.


Arnook

That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission!




Sokka, his hair loose and hanging in locks, appears stunned before crossing his arms in anger.


Hahn

All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Chō in no time!


Sokka

[Irritated, waves arms in gesture.] It's Admiral Zhao!




The scene changes to outside on the water where Zuko rows past, navigating his way through the path of ice spikes. Cuts to a view of a Water Tribe guard on patrol, pausing and looking out over the horizon just as Zuko's canoe disappears behind an ice spike. The guard continues walking. Cuts back to Zuko who continues to paddle toward the wall, before switching to a shot of him peering from behind an ice spike, his canoe pulled up onto the ice. Camera cuts to and zooms in on a shot of several Water Tribe guards marching atop the wall. Zuko turns around and sees a group of turtle seals resting by a hole in the ice. One seal plunges head first into the icy water. Zuko looks back up to the wall and begins approaching the hole.


Zuko

[Peering down into the hole.] Where are they going? [Cuts to a shot of the hole, his face reflected in the water.] They're coming up for air somewhere.




He pulls down the mask covering his mouth and nose and inhales deeply. Cuts to shot of Zuko from beneath the water; he plunges into the water. The scene changes, cutting to a shot of the waxing gibbous moon hanging in the sky.


Yue

[Off camera.] The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. [Cuts to shot of her, Katara and Aang standing on a balcony, looking up at the sky.] Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves.


Katara

I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.


Yue

Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. [Camera pans slightly downward, showing Aang with a dull expression on his face.] They work together to keep balance.


Aang

[Brightening.] The spirits! [Raises head, startling Momo.] Maybe I can find them and get their help!


Yue

How can you do that?


Katara

[Approaching her.] The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!


Yue

[To Aang.] Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!


Aang

[Waves arms out in gesture.] Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation! [The two girls look at him oddly; Aang looks at them and straightens up.] Or wisdom. That's good, too.


Katara

The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?


Yue

I have an idea. Follow me.




She begins walking away. Cuts to a shot of the chief's Royal Palace, the camera panning downward to the ground where Yue walks by, followed by Aang and Katara. Cuts to shot of Yue standing by a small, round wooden door, Aang approaching close behind.


Aang

[Walking up to the door.] So, is this the way to the Spirit World?


Yue

[Laughs.] No. You'll have to get there on your own. [Leans inward.] But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole. [Opens the door.]




Aang steps inside. The camera pans upward and zooms in to reveal a small verdant oasis lying ahead, a waterfall flowing directly behind it. Zooms in on Aang, who gasps in amazement.


Aang

[Runs to the back of the oasis and rolls around on the ground.] I never thought I'd miss grass this much!


Katara

[Approaching the oasis.] It's so warm here! How is that possible?


Yue

It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.




The two girls remove their coats. Cuts to view of two fish, one black and one white, swimming about in the pond. Momo sticks his hand in the pond and tries to grab the two fish in the water. Cuts to shot of the two girls standing over him, looking rather irritated.


Aang

You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil. [Positions himself to meditate.]




Meanwhile, Zuko emerges from the water through another hole in the ice. He lies on his back on the ice and catches his breath. He rolls over onto his side, begins shivering and breathes fire to warm himself.


Zuko

[To the barking turtle seals.] Be quiet!




The pack of seals quiets down. Cuts to shot of several seals, who watch as Zuko walks past, pushing aside the heads of two of them. They resume barking. He makes his way through another opening where water is pouring out. Cuts to shot of his foot boring into the wall as he tries to steady himself and make his way through the channel of water. Cuts to inside the channel, where he slowly crawls his way through. Cut back to the warriors' base. Sokka is crouched on the floor, sharpening his boomerang when he is approached.


Arnook

Is something wrong, Sokka?


Sokka

[Sarcastically.] Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine.


Arnook

Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you.


Sokka

What, you want me to scrub the barracks?


Arnook

I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.


Sokka

[Rises and tries to act cool.] Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard.




Arnook exits the scene; Sokka's face falls. Zuko continues to make his way through the channel of water. He exits from the channel and floats to the surface of the water. He emerges from the surface and inhales deeply several times. He proceeds to duck his head under the water, surveying the area. The camera zooms in on another channel. Zuko swims toward the channel and upward. As he attempts to resurface, however, the surface of the water had frozen into a thick ice patch. Zuko tries to break through the ice. He suddenly exhales, signaling his need for air. He heats his hands using firebending and melts a hole in the ice. Cuts to a tunnel way in the city, the ice steaming and finally melting away. Zuko emerges and catches his breath. He relaxes against the wall of the tunnel. The scene changes back to the Spirit Oasis, where Aang is meditating, Katara and Yue watching him.


Yue

Why is he sitting like that?


Katara

He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. [Aang scrunches up his face in concentration.] It takes all his concentration.


Yue

Is there any way we can help?


Aang

[Angrily.] How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!




The camera zooms in on the pond, where the two koi fish are shown circling each other. Cuts to shot of beneath the pond, showing an underside-view of the two fish. Cuts to shot of Aang staring at the fish, seemingly mesmerized. Cuts back to two fish circling each other before switching back to Aang. Cuts back to image of the two fish, which morphs into an image of the symbols for yin and yang. Cuts back to Aang, as his eyes and tattoos to light up.


Yue

[Worried.] Is he okay?


Katara

He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. [Cuts to overhead shot of the pond.] That's his way back to the physical world.


Yue

Maybe we should get some help.


Katara

[Smiling.] No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.


Zuko

[Sarcastically.] Well, aren't you a big girl now.


Katara

[Alarmed and dismayed.] No ...


Zuko

[Determined.] Yes. Hand him over and I won't have to hurt you.




Yue runs from the scene as Katara assumes a defensive stance, Zuko appearing on screen. Cuts to Zuko, who kicks up his leg, sending a fire blast Katara's way. He fires more blasts from his hands. Cuts to shot of Zuko and Katara, Zuko continually firing as Katara conjures up water shields to deflect the attacks. Cuts to Katara, who draws water from the pond and sends the stream at Zuko, who is preparing another attack. The blast pushes Zuko back several feet and knocks him to the ground.


Zuko

[Rising.] I see you've learned a new trick, but I didn't come this far to lose to you.




He turns around and fires another blast which Katara blocks by summoning another shield of water. Cuts to shot of Zuko, Katara, and Aang as Katara sends a powerful jet of water at her opponent. The jet collides into Zuko, who is sent farther back. As he attempts to steady himself from the impact, small juts of ice form around his feet. Cuts to close-up of Katara, a determined look on her face. Water begins rising around Zuko and encircling him. Katara waves her arms about wildly, forming a ball of water around him which she freezes solid. Cuts to close-up of her as she smiles triumphantly. Cuts to Zuko imprisoned in the ice.


Zuko

You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?




The globule of ice begins glowing bright orange with heat and the ground rumbles. Cuts to view of entire globule as it heats up intensely before melting. He fires repeated attacks at Katara, who draws water from the oasis to deflect the attacks. She prepares to strike him with a water blast, however, Zuko manages to slip away and head toward Aang. Just as his fingers grasp Aang's collar, Katara fires a water blast, throwing Zuko to the other wall. She whips up a large wave and sends the attack at Zuko. The rush of water sends Zuko up the side of the cliff; she freezes the water, encasing him in ice. Cuts to Pakku who looks over the horizon in the city as the sun rises. The scene cuts to Zhao's ship.


Zhao

It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.




Back to the Spirit Oasis, rays of sunlight beam down on Zuko, who remains imprisoned in the ice, his head bent down. He feels the heat and sharply raises his head. With a determined look on his face, he breathes steam from his nose, melting the ice quickly. He lands on the ground and fires a blast at Katara, who had her back turned to him at that moment. She turns around swiftly and attempts to deflect the blast by conjuring a water shield; however, she creates the shield too late. The blast sends her slamming into the gate to the Spirit World, knocking her out. Smoke from the impact fills the screen. Cuts to shot of Zuko standing over her, holding Aang by the collar.


Zuko

You rise with the moon ... I rise with the sun.




The scene changes to where Fire Navy ships break through the city wall, their bows crumbling the wall, allowing soldiers armed with spears to rush in.


Zhao

The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today.




Cuts back to the oasis. Camera focuses on a close-up of Katara, whose eyes suddenly snap open as she regains consciousness, only to realize Aang is gone. She crawls around, desperately searching for him.


Katara

Aang!




Sokka and Yue enter on Appa.


Sokka

What happened? Where's Zuko?


Katara

[Dismayed.] He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.




Cuts to shot of Momo looking sorrowfully from the edge of the pond.


Sokka

[Off-camera.] Where did they go ...




The camera pans upward to above the oasis where Zuko is seen walking through a blizzard with Aang in tow. Cuts to shot of them walking away. The camera pans upward to show the snow falling.




Fades to credits.



The episode opens to the Northern Water Tribe as the siege continues. Four fireballs streak past the screen. Cuts to overhead shot of the city as the fireballs strike various locations. The camera pans downward past the Tribal Chief's palace to the Spirit Oasis where Appa can be seen presiding by the pond. Cuts to shot of the two koi fish, the Moon and Ocean Spirits, swimming in their usual circular pattern. 


Katara

[Off-screen; sorrowfully.] I can't believe I lost him.




Cut to full shot of the pond, Sokka and Yue standing beside Katara, who is kneeling on the ground.


Sokka

You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. [Cuts to shot of Katara who looks up at her brother, tears in her eyes.] Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.


Katara

Okay. [Closes eyes and gets up. Camera pans over to where Momo remains motionless on the ground. Cuts to shot of Appa, Katara having mounted the bison.] It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.


Sokka

Yip, yip.




The camera pans upward as Appa takes off, heading upward to a location above the oasis, a vast frozen tundra where a blizzard is raging. Cuts to shot of the icy terrain of the tundra as the bison progresses. Cuts to shot of the ground, a path visible in the snow where someone has clearly been trudging along; the camera pans upward. Cuts to shot of Zuko plodding through the snow, his face partially covered to protect him from the cold, Aang slung across his back. Cuts to shot of an unconscious Aang, his tattooed arrows glowing.
The scene changes suddenly, zooming out on Aang who is sitting in a meditating position on a small wooden platform in an unknown location in the Spirit World. Cuts to shot of his surroundings which are not that of the icy tundra, but a mystical swamp dotted with trees. A large white bird of some sort flies past. Cuts to shot of Aang as the bird flies over the screen; he stands and begins wandering about. Cuts to shot of a figure in the distance sitting beneath a simple wooden entranceway. The figure can be heard uttering the sound "Ohm". Aang appears on-screen, turns his head in the direction of the sound and begins making his way toward the figure. Cuts to side-view of the figure, a monkey-like creature, as Aang approaches him, before cutting to a shot of the two with the figure's back to the camera.



Aang

Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.


Baboon spirit

[Cut to a frontal shot of the baboon spirit.] Go. Away. [Opens one eye. Cut back to the side-shot.] You're still here?


Aang

Yes, I need -


Baboon spirit

[Cut to close-up of the baboon spirit who shuts his eyes tightly. Louder, trying to distract himself.] Ohm! [A firefly flies past; points at the insect.] Perhaps that thing will help you. Chase it. [Aang runs after it. The mystical monkey keeps his eyes shut for a second more before opening one to confirm Aang's departure. He shakes his head and breathes a sigh of relief.] Finally.




Cuts to a shot of Aang chasing the insect throughout the swamp and up a tree. He leaps up and manages to grasp hold of it and is delighted in doing so. Cuts to zoomed out shot of him as he lands on a tree branch which instantly shrivels up and disappears entirely, causing him to fall. Cuts briefly to close-up shot of an alarmed Aang before switching to a shot of him falling into the water. Aang is shown lying on his back in the water, the firefly having escaped his grip. It flies away as he tries to reach it again.


Aang

Come back!




He stands up. Cuts to shot of him looking down at the water, when Roku suddenly appears before Aang in a reflection in the water.


Roku

Hello, Aang.


Aang

[Looking at him; surprised.] Roku!




The scene cuts back to the real world, where Zuko continues his trek through the icy tundra. Cuts to close-up of him before a shot of the ground where he steps on ice that begins cracking beneath his feet; his eyes widen in surprise at this. Cuts to overhead shot of him, the camera zooming out, as the ice begins to splinter and cave in. Cuts to shot of him on high alert as he begins running, before switching to an overhead shot of him as he races through the snow. Cuts to shot of him as the impact of the ice caving in throws him off-balance.
Zuko is thrown several feet away and lands roughly in the snow, losing his grip on Aang and kicking up a cloud of snow. The cloud dissipates, showing Zuko and Aang lying in the snow. Cuts to shot of Zuko, as he raises his head and looks at the scene. Cuts to shot of the aftermath of the cave-in, the ground severely disrupted, and a shot of Zuko once more. He spots a cave off in the distance.



Zuko

Shelter. [Drags Aang into the cave and ties him up.]




Back in the Spirit World, Aang is speaking with Roku.


Aang

Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits.


Roku

[Pops out of the reflection in front of Aang.] The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning. There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.


Aang

Who?


Roku

The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. [Aang looks horrified.] When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face. [Aang looks even more horrified but calmly nods, understanding the situation.]




Meanwhile, in the real world, Katara, Sokka, and Yue arrive to where the ice broke earlier. In the cave, Zuko is keeping warm with Breath of Fire while Aang, now tied up, remains in the Spirit World.


Zuko

I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. [Stands up and looks outside the cave.] There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.




Meanwhile, back at the invasion, the Fire Nation has breached part of the wall. On the lead ship, Zhao and Iroh are speaking.


Iroh

I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.


Zhao

I assure you I have everything under control. I intend to remove the moon as a factor.


Iroh

[Shocked.] Remove the moon? How?




Hahn appears behind them and points his spear at Zhao.


Hahn

Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate!




He charges at Zhao, who casually tosses him overboard as he is still screaming. A loud splash is heard, while Iroh shakes his head in disappointment.


Zhao

[Continuing as if nothing happened.] As I was saying, years ago I stumble upon a great and powerful secret: the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form.


Iroh

What?


Zhao

I was a young lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom. [Fade to a flashback of a young Zhao tearing through scrolls in a library.] I discovered a hidden library. Underground, in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration, and the words "moon" and "ocean". I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. [The memory ends with a close up of Zhao's eyes, fade to the present.] And that it was my destiny to do so.


Iroh

[Somewhat angrily.] Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!


Zhao

Yes, yes ... I know you fear the spirits, Iroh. I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences.




Back in the Spirit World, Aang walks up a giant tree, seeing the entrance to the cave Koh can be found in. Aang stares and slightly steps toward the cave hearing creepy noises. He glances to his left noticing that the noise wasn't coming from the cave. Aang sighs in relief.


Aang

You're just a curly tailed blue nose.




The monkey turns its head toward Aang, exposing that he has no face.


Aang

[Startled.] Aaahhh! [Aang takes a deep breath and speaks with his and Avatar Roku's voices combined.] Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.




Aang steps into the cave with a straight face.


Aang

Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.




As Aang says the spirit's name, some "roots" on the ceiling begin to move. Aang looks around, sensing movement, but sees nothing. Cut to a close-up of Aang's face that pans slightly left, leaving the right hand portion of the screen over his shoulder momentarily empty. A moment later, a white face appears with gray patches around its eyes and luscious, blood-red lips. Cut to a close-up of the lips, which smile. Cut to a profile of Aang, his face emotionless. Suddenly, a huge centipede-like body arcs around Aang and appears in front of his face. The white, clown-like face of Koh is inches away from Aang. Around the spirit's face are eight additional legs.


Koh

[Creepily, circling Aang.] Welcome!




Aang keeps his face straight. Cut to a long shot; the spirit hangs from the ceiling in front of Aang, who bows with his hands clasped in front of him in a gesture of honor.


Aang

[Emotionlessly.] Thank you. [Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from behind. His voice is low and melodic, almost purring.]


Koh

My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.


Aang

You know me?


Koh

[Now facing the camera, away from Aang.] How could I forget [He switches with a "winking" effect, as if some sort of nictitating membrane closes briefly over the old face to reveal a new one, to a mad face of a middle-aged, mustached man with thick eyebrows, long mustache, and beard; angrily.] you? One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me! Nearly eight or nine hundred years ago.


Aang

[Confused, yet seriously.] I didn't know that. Why did he, or I, try to kill you?


Koh

[Switches to Ummi's scared, sad face.] Oh, it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved. [Cut to a close-up of Aang with the camera slowing, zooming in on his face. Cut back to Koh, whose face turns malicious and switches to a baboon's while laughing. Switch to a side-shot; Aang keeps a straight face while not taking his eyes off Koh as he circles around him.] Of course, that's all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life? After all, you're a different person now. [Speaks into Aang's ear from behind.] You've come to me ... with a new face.




Aang closes his eyes and takes a deep breath to the words into his ear, crossing the scene to the real world, Zuko seeing his breath.


Zuko

Guess we'll be here awhile.




Cut to exterior of the cave. Cut to Appa in the blizzard.


Yue

Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.


Katara

I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.


Sokka

They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them.




The screen flashes white back to the Spirit World to Aang's talk with the face stealer, Koh circling loosely around Aang.


Koh

[Continues to circle around Aang.] It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection. [His face is now that of an owl.] So ... how may I help you?


Aang

I need to find the moon and the ocean.


Koh

Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.


Aang

[Side-view of Aang.] Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help. [Top-down view of Koh who changes his face to that of an old man. Aang is visible below him.]


Koh

Oh, you think you need their help. [Koh looks to the side.] Actually it's quite the other way round. [In an instant, Koh turns and bolts to Aang, stopping just short of the young Avatar; with an angry blue ogre-like face with red eyes and upright fangs.] Someone's going to kill them! [Aang closes his eyes briefly before opening them to look at Koh.]


Aang

What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?


Koh

[Flipping back to his white face.] You've already met them, actually. [View of Koh from behind Aang as Koh moves to look away, turning his back on Aang.] Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, [Close-up of Aang's face.] good and evil, yin and yang.




Aang's eyes open wide as he experiences a flashback of the white and black fish circling each other in the pond and the vision he had of them as they turned into the yin and yang symbol just before he entered the Spirit World. Back to Aang.


Aang

[Excitedly.] The koi fish! [Hearing the emotion in Aang's voice, Koh quickly reels around to stare at the now expressionless face of Aang.] I must be going now.


Koh

[Flipping to the face of a bald, young man.] We'll meet again.




Koh recedes into the shadows as Aang walks out of his cave. Cut to Aang running in front of the tree that is Koh's lair. He stops and talks to the ground.


Aang

The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.


Roku

[Cut to Roku's image on the ground.] A friend is here, to guide you back.


Aang

[Aang turns around; excitedly.] Hei Bai!




The spirit groans as Aang jumps onto him and sets off. Cut back to the physical world. Two fireballs hit the city. Cut to two Water Tribe members fleeing as a tank destroys a totem pole behind them. Cut to two Water Tribe members trying to stop a tank. Cut to a view of the ocean with many fire navy ships and the moon looming behind. Cut to a bridge as two fire navy soldiers move in front of the camera as a waterbender drops down to move the bridge back from where the fire navy soldiers came from, taking the soldiers with it. Cut to a waterbender facing a tank, submerging the tank in the snow and ice around it. Cut to waterbenders attacking fire navy soldiers with shards of ice, who use shields to protect themselves. Cut to a shot behind Pakku who freezes and takes down eight oncoming soldiers. Pakku dodges a fire blast, having become surrounded with tanks and soldiers. Unleashing a wave of water he slices tanks wheels off and freezes soldiers behind him in ice. Pakku lifts himself into the air with water while being fired upon by firebenders. Avoiding the blasts, he knocks the firebenders away using his water cyclone as a wave. Cut to waterbenders sending a tank flying toward Zhao.


Zhao

We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there, we're going fishing. [He smirks.]




Cut back to the Spirit World. Aang arrives at his starting location and jumps off Hei Bai.


Aang

This is where I came in, but how do I get back?




Hei Bai stands on his hind legs and sends a beam of energy at Aang, who disappears to the physical world.


Baboon spirit

[Cut to baboon spirit sitting on a rock. Opening his eyes.] Good riddance.




Hei Bai, having assumed his monstrous form, shoots an intense beam from his mouth at the baboon spirit sending it flying, before reverting to his original form. Back in the physical world, cut to a view of the arch way and water.


Aang

Momo! [Walking toward Momo. Closer view of Aang with Momo.] Momo. Oh no, where's my body?




Aang is surrounded by energy and flies into the air. Cut to a wide-view of the entire Water Tribe city as Aang continues to fly toward the cave. Cut to close shot of Katara. Noticing Aang she turns around. Cut to shot of Appa flying in the sky as Aang shoots past overhead to the cave.


Katara

Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!




Cut to Aang entering the cave, filling it with light. Cut to Aang waking up, attempting to get out of his restraints and noticing Zuko.


Zuko

Welcome back.


Aang

[Cut to close-up of Aang as he narrows his eyes.] It's good to be back.




Aang airbends Zuko into a wall and propelling himself backward out of the cave. Cut to cave exterior. Close-up of Aang wriggling like a worm in an attempt to get away, only to be caught by Zuko.


Zuko

[Zuko pulls Aang up by his collar as seen from behind Aang.] That won't be enough to escape.


Aang

[On seeing Appa.] Appa!




Appa lands. Katara slides off. Close-up of Zuko.


Zuko

[Throwing the tied-up Aang aside who yelps.] Here for a rematch?


Katara

[Confidently while countering his fire blasts.] Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.




Katara uses waterbending to launch Zuko into the air before plummeting him down to the ground, knocking him out. Close-up shot of Sokka running toward Aang to untie him with Zuko lying unconscious.


Sokka

Hey, this is some quality rope!


Aang

We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!




Switch to a wide-view of the area with Aang airbending himself atop Appa. Close-up shot of Aang landing on Appa.


Aang

Wait, we can't just leave him here.


Sokka

Sure we can. Let's go.


Aang

No, if we leave him he'll die.




Aang airbends himself off Appa and retrieves Zuko, bringing him to Appa.


Sokka

[Sarcastically.] Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.




Appa takes off. Cut to Tui and La in the oasis lake. Zhao grabs Tui from the water, placing it in a sack. The moon goes red, followed by everything else. Cut to close-up of the now red moon. Cut to a view of the entire city turning red. Cut to Pakku who loses his waterbending and falls to the ground. Cut to a waterbender attempting to waterbend but loses his bending. Cut to three more waterbenders, bending water, but they too lose their bending. Cut to Fire Navy soldiers firebending. Cut to Appa flying with the red moon behind him. Appa groans as it cuts to the saddle.


Sokka

[Yue grabs her head as if in pain.] Are you okay?


Yue

I feel faint.


Aang

[Cut to Aang. Holding his head with one hand.] I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble.


Yue

[Cut back to the saddle.] I owe the Moon Spirit my life.


Sokka

What do you mean?


Yue

[Close-up of Yue.] When I was born I was very sick and very weak. [Flashback to Yue as a baby.] Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed. [Cut to waterbenders attempting to heal Yue as a baby.] Our healers did everything they could. [Panning shot of Yue and the waterbenders, along with Yue's parents.] They told my mother and father I was going to die. [Cut to Arnook staring at the moon.] My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. [Cut to shot panning down from the moon to the oasis.] That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond. [Cut to Yue being placed into the pond.] My dark hair turned white. [Close-up of Yue in the oasis.] I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live. [Cut to Yue in her parents arms with the archway and moon behind them.] That's why my mother named me Yue. [Cut back to Appa's saddle.] For the moon.


Zhao

[Cut to Zhao at the oasis.] I am ... a legend, now! [Cut to panning shot from Zhao's hand, grasping the bag with Tui in it, down to his head.] The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible! [Momo jumps on top of Zhao's head.] Ugh ... Get it off! Get it off!




Cut to wide-view of oasis as Momo flies away toward the camera. Panning view of Momo landing on Aang's arm and running to his shoulder, with Katara and Sokka are behind him. Cut to Zhao and his soldiers, readying themselves for battle. Cut to Aang, Sokka and Katara readying themselves. Panning shot of the oasis.


Zhao

Don't bother. [Close-up of Zhao as he lifts the sack up threatening to kill Tui.]


Aang

[Cut to Aang and the others surrendering.] Zhao, don't!


Zhao

[Cut to panning side-view.] It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe.


Aang

[Close-up side-view of Aang.] Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. [Close-up panning shot of the sack with Tui inside and Zhao.] It will hurt everyone, including you. [Cut to panning shot of the oasis.] Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world. [Cut to Zhao.]


Iroh

[Off-screen.] He is right Zhao.


Zhao

[Cut to wide shot of oasis; calmly to Iroh.] General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?


Iroh

[Close-up of Iroh while he takes off his hood.] I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!




Zhao releases the koi fish into the oasis. Cut to close-up of Zhao as he hesitates before striking the koi fish with a fire slice out of anger. Cut to wide-view of the oasis. Cut to Iroh recoiling from the flames. Cut to Aang looking on and up at the moon. Cut to a view from the oasis to the sky as the moon fades out and the world goes gray. Cut to Zhao looking up until Iroh begins firebending at him. Zhao dodges and counters his firebending while retreating toward his firebending soldiers. They are swiftly defeated as Zhao escapes. Cut to show La circling the now dead Tui. Cut to Aang and the others looking on in disbelief and moving toward the water. Yue is seen looking on; her forward movement reveals that Zuko has escaped from behind her. Iroh picks up the dead koi fish.


Yue

[Close-up of Yue and Sokka.] There's no hope now, it's over.


Aang

[Close-up of Aang entering the Avatar State.] No, it's not over.





Cut to wide shot of oasis as Aang enters the water. Cut back to the others looking on. Aang stands in a meditative stance as La circles him. Close-up shot of Aang and La as the latter's eyes light up. Side-view of Aang as he descends into the water. Wide shot of the whole oasis as blue lightning-like energy expands from the oasis island into the water. Wide shot of the Water Tribe city as the oasis begins to light up in the same blue color. Cut back to Katara and the others watching. The energy moves to the edge of the oasis, rising up to form a giant amphibious-like creature, facing out toward the sea, with Aang in the center, controlling it. Cut to the Fire Nation soldiers in the city looking on at this creature's sudden appearance. Cut briefly to Pakku and other Northern Water Tribe members before changing to a view of Aang moving past a river, Fire Nation soldiers on one side, Pakku and his group on the other. The Water Tribe all bow down as the Fire Nation soldiers prepare to attack. Aang, controlling the massive creature, begins to head to the ocean, laying waste to any Fire Nation soldiers on the way. 
Cut back to Zhao who continues to flee only to be attacked by Zuko.



Zhao

You're alive?


Zuko

[Angrily.] You tried to have me killed! [Zuko attacks Zhao.]


Zhao

[Close-up of Zhao's face.] Yes I did. [Zuko approaches Zhao as we see the giant energy form make its way toward the ocean.] You're the Blue Spirit, an enemy of the Fire Nation! You freed the Avatar.


Zuko

I had no choice. [Zuko continues his attacks, but they are blocked by Zhao.]


Zhao

You should have chosen to accept your failure; you're a disgrace. Then, at least, you could have lived! [Zuko and Zhao begin to fight.]




Back at the oasis, Iroh places the dead koi fish in the water.


Katara

It's too late, it's dead.


Iroh

[Iroh notices Yue.] You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. [Close-up of Yue.] Some of its life is in you.


Yue

Yes, you're right. It gave me life, maybe I can give it back.


Sokka

No! You don't have to do that. [Sokka reached to stop her.]


Yue

It's my duty, Sokka.


Sokka

I won't let you! [Close-up of him holding her hand.] Your father told me to protect you.


Yue

[Close-up of Yue.] I have to do this.




Yue's hand slips out of Sokka's as she places her hands on the koi fish. The koi begins to glow and Yue closes her eyes. 


Sokka

[Yue falls as Sokka catches her.] No! She's gone, she's gone.




Cut to Aang as he approaches the sea and sends the fire navy ships back out into the ocean. Aang continues to destroy ships and drive the rest back out. Cut back to Sokka holding Yue. Yue fades and disappears as the koi begins the light up and glow. Iroh places the koi back into the oasis water. The entire lake begins to light up until energy floats up into the air forming an image of Yue. Side-view of the oasis.


Yue

Goodbye, Sokka. [Close-up of Sokka and Yue as she comes to kiss him.] I'll always be with you.




They kiss and Yue disappears as Sokka looks up to the moon as it reappears in the sky, bringing the color back. Cut to Aang, still fused with the Ocean Spirit, in front of the Water Tribe city. Aang looks up and notices the moon has returned. The Ocean Spirit fades into the water and moves back to the city, dropping Aang off on a wall as he leaves the Avatar State.
Cut to Zuko and Zhao fighting on a bridge. Zuko gains the upper hand and Zhao notices the moon has returned.



Zhao

[Shot of the moon over Zhao's shoulder.] It can't be!




Zhao is consumed by the energy in the shape of a hand and dragged toward the water.


Zuko

Take my hand!




Zhao considers it for a moment before retracting his hand. The energy plummets into the water, Zhao dragged along with it, and dissipates. Cut to Pakku and others on a ledge overlooking the city. Cut to a close-up shot of Pakku, Katara stands behind him.


Pakku

I've decide to go to the South Pole. Some other benders and healers want to join me. It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.


Katara

What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.


Pakku

Well, then he better get used to calling you Master Katara.




Cut to Arnook and Sokka standing on the ledge looking at the moon.


Arnook

The spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born. I saw a beautiful, brave, young woman become the Moon Spirit. [Sighs.] I knew this day would come.


Sokka

You must be proud.


Arnook

So proud ... and sad.




Cut to Zuko and Iroh on a raft floating away from the city.


Iroh

I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.


Zuko

I'm tired.


Iroh

Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.




Cut to Aang looking out on the ledge in the city. Katara stands behind him. He realizes she's there and turns around. They embrace. Momo chitters.


Katara

You too, Momo.


Aang

Come here.




Momo leaps on to Aang's shoulders as we see Sokka place his hand on Aang's shoulder. All four of them look out to the ocean and the moon as Appa rises up in front of them.
Cut to Fire Lord Ozai's chambers. Cut to panning shot of Azula.



Ozai

Iroh is a traitor, and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you.




Close-up of Azula, looking up and smiling.




Fades to credits.
