The episode opens on Ember Island outside Ozai's beach house. Aang practices firebending punches. Zuko watches him with his arms crossed.


Zuko

More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!


Aang

[Stops firebending and turns to Zuko while growling in irritance.] I'm trying.


Zuko

Now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo! [Aang gives a light roar as fire bursts come out of his hands and mouth; cuts to a front scene of his embarrassed grin.] That sounded pathetic! I said roar!




Aang roars even louder, as three bursts of fire come out of his hands and mouth. Momo runs and hides behind Zuko's leg in fear. Zuko nods approvingly.


Katara

[Holding up two watermelons.] Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?


Aang

[Brightens up upon hearing this.] Ooh, ooh! Me, me, me! [Runs to Katara.]


Zuko

[Zuko's hand comes into screen and grabs Aang by the shirt of his robes.] Hey! [Aang keeps trying to run off, but it is useless.] Your lesson's not over yet! Get back here! [Holds Aang up.]


Suki

[Lounging on stairs with Sokka.] Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal?


Zuko

[Lets Aang go.] Fine! [Aang happily runs off and takes a watermelon.] If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead! [Walks away.]


Sokka

Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know [Lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly.] just the thing to change all that. [Takes off his robe, revealing a bathing suit.] Beach party!




Dives excitedly out of the camera's view. Camera changes scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash. Sokka surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth. He grins goofily. Katara uses waterbending to create an ice surfboard and surfs on the water. Cut to Suki, watching Sokka grab some seaweed and bring it to an area. He takes two buckets and fills them with water. Aang sticks the last piece of wood on a life-sized sand sculpture of Appa, finishing the last horn.


Aang

Check out my Appa sand sculpture. [Appa roars at the sculpture.]


Toph

Not bad, baldy, [Aang jumps off the sculpture.] but I've been working on my sandbending. [Cracks her fingers.] You're gonna love this.




Toph cracks her knuckles and uses sandbending to create a sand replica of the city of Ba Sing Se. Aang peers down at the replica's details.


Aang

[Amazed.] Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.




Sokka works hard on a sculpture.


Toph

Try and top that, Sokka.


Sokka

[Reveals a grotesque looking sculpture with seaweed for hair, a starfish for a nose, and rocks and shells for eyes and mouth.] Ta da!


Aang

Is that a blubbering blob monster?


Sokka

[Defensively.] No, it's Suki!




Aang looks at him with an animated shocked and surprised look until he and Toph both laugh hysterically.


Toph

Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.


Suki

[Sitting on a beach towel.] I think it's sweet.




Sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees as he grabs Suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek.


Aang

But it doesn't even look like- Aah!




He is cut off by a fire blast that destroys the sculpture. Zuko appears and chases after Aang, blasting at him with firebending. Aang jumps over the sand replica of Ba Sing Se and Zuko destroys the replica. Aang hides behind his Appa sand sculpture.


Aang

[Peeking out from behind the sculpture fearfully.] What are you doing?


Zuko

Teaching you a lesson!




Zuko destroys Aang's Appa sculpture with a fire blast. Aang jumps back up to the house. Zuko goes after him, continually firing blasts at him. Katara comes back to shore and sees the destruction.


Katara

What happened?


Sokka

[While rebuilding his sculpture.] Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it! [Pauses a moment.] Oh, and he's attacking Aang.




Katara, Toph, and Suki run after them, the latter dragging Sokka. Zuko chases Aang onto a tree and sends another fire blast at him, forcing him to jump onto the roof of the beach house. Zuko subsequently climbs onto the roof with him.


Aang

Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!


Zuko

Go ahead and do it!




Zuko blasts fire at him. Aang slides down the roof and into the house. He hides behind a dresser. Zuko breaks the roof with firebending and drops into the room. He takes a fighting stance and looks around for Aang. Aang kicks the dresser at him, but Zuko destroys it. Aang runs into the hall. Zuko augments fire into the hallway. Aang clears his part of the hallway from the fire using airbending.


Aang

Enough!




Aang airbends Zuko out of the house. Everyone approaches Zuko.


Katara

[Worried.] What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang!


Zuko

What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you? How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away? [Everybody looks at Zuko.] Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?


Aang

About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.


Zuko

[Shocked.] After?


Aang

I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending.


Toph

And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. [Aang grimaces.]


Zuko

So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?


Sokka

Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose. [Aang looks over to Sokka as he says this, frowns, and closes his eyes in defeat. To Aang.] No offense.


Katara

The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.


Zuko

You're wrong. [Turns away from them.] It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. [Flashes back to one day before the Day of Black Sun. Servants help Zuko get dressed on his way to a meeting. Once done, they stay behind and bow to him as he walks on. Voice-over.] The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back.


Ozai

Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you. [Zuko walks up to his father. He bows to Ozai and sits down next to him.] General Shinu, your report.


Shinu

Thank you, sir. [Stands up and walks up to the opposite side of Ozai across the table.] Ba Sing Se is still under our control. However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom.


Ozai

What is your recommendation?


Shinu

Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom.


Ozai

Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?


Zuko

The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything, as long as they have hope.


Ozai

Yes, you're right. We need to destroy their hope.


Zuko

Well, that's not exactly what I-


Azula

I think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground.


Ozai

Yes ... [Cuts to Azula looking pleased.] Yes you're right, Azula. [Stands up and walks to the world map.] Sozin's Comet is almost upon us, and on that day, it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns. No bender will stand a chance against us.


Shinu

What are you suggesting, sir?


Ozai

When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. [Cut to Zuko.] Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom ... [Zuko looks astonished. Cut back to Ozai smiling.] permanently. [The shot changes to an aerial view of the map which Ozai walks to the center.] From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything! [War generals applaud.]


Zuko

[Voice-over.] I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't. [Fade to the present.] My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was.


Katara

[Sinks to her knees.] I can't believe this.


Sokka

I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.


Aang

What am I gonna do?


Zuko

[Stands up from his rock seat and walks to Aang.] I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.


Aang

Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner? [Walks away.]


Zuko

I didn't think I had to. I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait.


Aang

[Holding his head with both hands.] This is bad. [Sinks down to his knees.] This is really, really bad.


Katara

Aang, you don't have to do this alone.




Toph, Zuko, Sokka, and Suki stand next to Katara.


Toph

Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.


Sokka

All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. [Shot of Aang.] Water. [Shot of Katara.] Earth. [Shot of Toph.] Fire. [Shot of Zuko. Sokka gives Suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf.] Fan and sword! [Sokka's leaf wilts.]


Aang

Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.




Everybody except Zuko laughs and walks over to Aang for a group hug.


Toph

Yeah.


Sokka

All right.


Katara

Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.




With a resigned look on his face, Zuko joins the hug. Appa flies in, knocking the entire group over. The camera cuts to the beach house courtyard in another lesson between Aang and Zuko. Under the pavilion, Katara watches with Momo at her side.


Zuko

There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning. [Aang smiles.] If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. [Uses his fingers to show how the energy should flow through the body.] You turn your opponents' energy against them.


Aang

That's like waterbending. [Joins Zuko in practicing the lightning redirection form.]


Zuko

Exactly. My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.


Aang

So, have you ever redirected lightning before?


Zuko

Once, against my father.


Aang

What did it feel like?


Zuko

[Stops practicing the lightning redirection form.] Exhilarating ... [Flashes back to the moment for a few seconds.] but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.


Aang

[Chuckles.] Well, not over over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, [Turns to Katara.] am I right?


Katara

Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.


Aang

[Disappointed.] Oh.


Zuko

You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.


Aang

Yeah, I'll just do that.




The scene changes to the rocky cliffs near the beach.


Sokka

Gather round, Team Avatar. [Puts a carved melon on a draped mannequin.] In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect. [Kneels down on the ground and uses a stick to draw a line heading toward the Melon Lord symbol.] First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, [Draws another line.] and while the Melon Lord is distracted, [Draws a third line.] Aang swoops in ... and bam! [Destroys the Melon Lord symbol with the line.] He delivers the final blow.


Toph

Uh ... what about me?


Sokka

For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.


Toph

[Excited.] So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?


Sokka

Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.


Toph

Sweetness.




Fade to the Melon Lord. The camera pulls back to show Toph surrounded by boulder coated in grease with small bowls of fire set out in front of each boulder.


Toph

Mwah-ha-ha-ha!




Katara and Sokka look at Aang and Momo who look at Suki and Sokka. Sokka signals to the others to start moving. Sokka and Suki run toward the Melon Lord, but become confronted by stone Fire Nation soldiers, who suddenly rise out of the ground. Sokka cuts one stone soldier in half and Suki kicks down another one. They keep running, but a large burning rock boulder falls out of the sky, blocking the camera's view of them. Suki jumps over the boulder. Sokka finds himself fallen down just a few inches away from the flaming boulder and jumps up.


Sokka

Watch it, Toph!


Toph

I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!




Toph lights a second boulder on fire and sends it through the air at Zuko and Katara. They run around the boulder and become surrounded by a circle of stone Fire Nation soldiers, which they quickly destroy.


Sokka

Now, Aang!




Aang jumps, preparing to strike the Melon Lord with his glider staff. Aang looks at the Melon Lord and changes expressions from anger to uncertainty. When he lands, Aang stops his attack just before smashing the Melon Lord. He backs away.


Zuko

What are you waiting for? Take him out!


Aang

[Shaking his head.] I can't.


Sokka

[Walks up to Aang.] What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.


Aang

I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.




Sokka takes out his sword. Cut to Aang, wincing as he hears squishing sounds.


Sokka

[Off-camera.] There, that's how it's done.




A piece of melon falls on the ground near the Melon Lord. Momo slurps some melon juice out of the piece. The camera zooms toward Aang, who is horrified at the scene. Later that night, Team Avatar shares a meal outside. Aang faces away from the rest of the group.


Katara

[Holding a scroll.] I have a surprise for everyone!


Toph

I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! [She smiles while Sokka, Suki, and Zuko look at her strangely.]


Katara

Uh, no. [Everybody else starts eating again.] I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! [Unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy dark-haired baby playing at the beach.] Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?




Everybody except Zuko laughs.


Katara

[To Zuko.] Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing.


Zuko

That's not me. It's my father.




Katara rolls up the scroll.


Suki

But he looks so sweet and innocent.


Zuko

Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.


Aang

[The camera pans to him.] But he's still a human being.


Zuko

You're going to defend him?


Aang

No, I agree with you. [Stands up.] Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.


Zuko

Like what?


Aang

I don't know. [Perking up.] Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.


Zuko

[Sarcastically.] Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. [Suki and Sokka laugh in the background.]


Aang

[Excitedly.] Do you really think that would work?


Zuko

[Bluntly.] No!


Aang

[Sighs. Paces back and forth.] This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.


Sokka

Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.


Aang

[Turns back to Sokka; losing his temper.] This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in.


Katara

Aang, we do understand. It's just ...


Aang

Just what, Katara? What?


Katara

We're trying to help!


Aang

Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! [Walks away.]


Katara

Aang, don't walk away from this. [Walks toward Aang.]


Zuko

[Puts a hand on Katara's shoulder to stop her.] Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.




Aang meditates at the beach house porch in front of four candles, some berries, a plate of fruit, and a small cup of water. Momo flies in front of Aang.


Aang

[Stroking the lemur's head.] Hey, Momo. I don't suppose you know what I should do. [Momo squawks.] I didn't think so.




Momo lays down to rest, and soon Aang falls asleep too after the candles have burnt out. The camera pans out from the beach house to an island. Aang wakes up to chanting and walks toward the mysterious island, barely awake with Momo following him. Aang starts swimming when he reaches the water. The scene changes to the next morning and the mysterious island is gone. Appa eats some hay while Sokka sits on his saddle.


Sokka

Okay, that's everything.


Toph

No, it's not. Where's Aang?




Team Avatar runs to the beach house.


Zuko

Aang? Aang!


Toph

Come on, lazy bones, let's go.




Suki and Katara run to check one side of the beach house. Sokka, Zuko, and Toph run to check the other side. Zuko opens a door, but does not find Aang. Toph shrugs to show Zuko she has not found him either. Zuko checks the porch, scratching his head. He spots Aang's staff as Katara and Suki follow him.


Sokka

He left his staff. [Picks up the staff.] That's so strange.


Zuko

[Walks onto the porch with Toph.] Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. [Turns his head toward the beach.]




Fade to the beach.


Sokka

Look, there's his footprints. [The camera pans up toward Aang's footprints, which stop at the beach.] The trail ends here.


Suki

So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?


Katara

Maybe he was captured.


Sokka

I don't think so. [Examining the footprints.] There's no sign of a struggle.


Toph

I bet he ran away again.


Sokka

Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.


Toph

Then what do you think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?


Sokka

It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.


Zuko

But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?


Sokka

[Downcast.] Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.


Katara

Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.




Toph latches onto Zuko's arm. Zuko blushes.


Toph

I'm going with Zuko! [Sokka, Suki, and Katara stare at her.] What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.




Sokka rides on Appa, searching the shores for Aang. In Harbor City, Suki and Katara approach a group of people gathered in a circle.


Crowd

[Chanting.] Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! [Shocked, Katara and Suki glance at each other and simultaneously run into the circle.]


Actress Aang

[In the center of the crowd.] Avatar State! [Actor Toph lifts her up in the air.] Yip-yip! [Crowd cheers.]




Suki and Katara become frustrated by the false lead. The scene changes to Toph and Zuko walking along the beach.


Toph

And then when I was nine, I ran away again.


Zuko

Uh-huh.


Toph

I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?


Zuko

[Sighs and stops walking.] Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. [Continues walking.]


Toph

This is the worst field trip ever. [Sighs and continues walking.]




Later, back at the beach house, Toph, Zuko, Suki, and Katara sit on the beach house stairs. Sokka lands Appa below the stairs.


Sokka

Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either. [Jumps off Appa.]


Zuko

No. It's like he just ... disappeared.


Toph

Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?


Sokka

[Turns back to Appa.] Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time! [Jumps down to Appa.] Appa ate Momo! [Lifts up Appa's mouth.] Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.


Katara

Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.


Sokka

That's just what Appa wants you to think. [Climbs into Appa's mouth.]


Zuko

Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away.


Katara

What should we do Zuko?




Katara, Suki, and Toph turn to stare at Zuko. In the background, Sokka slips out of Appa's mouth, covered in bison saliva.


Zuko

[Stands up.] I don't know. [They keep staring.] Why are you all looking at me?


Katara

Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.


Toph

Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you.




Sokka tries standing up in the background, but falls back down. Zuko nods. The scene changes to Appa flying along the coast, led by Zuko.


Sokka

Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.


Zuko

Just trust me.




An aerial shot of the Royal Palace. Ozai and Azula travel in palanquins to a ship.


Azula

[To her palanquin bearers.] Come on slowpokes! Faster!




Ozai walks out of his palanquin and up the stairs. Azula runs behind him and gets on one knee to bow.


Azula

[Pants.] Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?


Ozai

[Facing the ship.] There has been a change of plans, Azula.


Azula

[Worried.] What?


Ozai

I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation.


Azula

But I thought we were going to do this together.


Ozai

My decision is final.


Azula

You ... you can't treat me like this! [Rising.] You can't treat me like Zuko!


Ozai

Azula, silence yourself.


Azula

But it was my idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!


Ozai

Azula! [She bows her head.] Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you.


Azula

Really?


Ozai

And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.


Azula

Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?


Ozai

Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world. [Three Fire Sages help Ozai put on his new royal garments.] From this moment on, I will be known as ... [Raises his arms in the air.] the Phoenix King.




Servants pull up the phoenix emblem behind Ozai. Soldiers raise the phoenix flags beside the Fire Nation flags. Two more soldiers firebend into the base of the flag pole, causing fire to shoot out at the sides. The crowd bows before their new king. The camera cuts to Ozai and zooms out. Cut to an aerial view of a tavern as Team Avatar approaches. Inside the tavern, lively music plays. Zuko enters, followed by Katara, Sokka, Suki, and Toph.


Katara

And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?


Zuko

[Pointing.] June.




The camera zooms toward June, who holds a drink. A thug tries to attack her, but she makes him fall down and uses him as a foot rest. Another thug tries to punch her, but she dodges every punch, still holding her drink.


Sokka

[Off-camera.] Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.


Suki

[Off-camera.] Mole? Her skin is flawless.


Sokka

No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.


Zuko

The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him.




The second thug continues punching June. She throws her drink into the air, throws the thug at a table, catches her drink and takes a sip.


Toph

[Stepping forward, grinning broadly.] I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her.




Cut to Aang sleeping on a mysterious island, while Momo licks his cheek.


Aang

[Waking up.] Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream. [Looks around surprised at his new setting.] Wait. [The camera pans toward the ocean and shows an aerial shot of the island.] Where are we?




Fade to credits.



The episode opens at night to a wide shot of the Earth Kingdom tavern, Appa resting outside. Cut inside to frontal view of Team Avatar, sans Aang. June kicks a chair in the foreground and sits down and begins drinking her tea.


Sokka

[To Zuko.] Hey, I remember her! [Cut to frontal view of Zuko, Sokka standing behind.] She helped you attack us!


Zuko

Yup. [Walks forward.] Back in the good old days.




Cut to wide shot as they all walk up to June.


June

Oh great. It's Prince Pouty. [Close-up.] Where's your creepy grandpa?


Zuko

[Frontal view of Katara and Zuko.] He's my uncle. And he's not here.


June

[Close-up.] I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.




Cut to Zuko and Katara who become flustered and embarrassed, looking at each other as they speak, before cutting to June.


Katara

[Angrily.] I'm not his girlfriend!


Zuko

[Speaking at the same time.] She's not my girlfriend!


June

[Frontal view.] Okay, okay. Sheesh. I was only teasing. So what do you want?


Zuko

[Frontal view of June with Zuko and Suki behind.] I need your help finding the Avatar.


June

Hm. Doesn't sound too fun. [Sips her tea.]


Zuko

[Angrily; leans closer, while clenching his fists.] Does the end of the world sound like more fun?




Cut to side-view of Appa and Nyla growling at each other. Appa licks Nyla, and they lay down. They both stand up as the gang and June walking toward them. Cut to frontal view of the approaching group as June holds up a piece of meat.


June

[Shaking the piece of meat.] Nyla. [She throws the meat to Nyla. Cut to frontal view of Nyla, who catches it in his mouth and starts chewing it before swallowing it; June walks up to him and starts petting him.] Who's my little, hmm, Snuffly-Wuffly? [Nyla sticks his toxins-coated tongue out and she dodges it and forces his mouth closed.] Whoa! Careful there. [To Team Avatar.] Okay. So who's got something with the Avatar's scent on it?




Cut to Katara standing on Appa's back.


Katara

[Pulls out Aang's glider from Appa's saddle.] I have Aang's staff.




Cut to Nyla as June approaches and holds the staff out in front of Nyla. He sniffs it. Cut to wide-view of the group as Nyla begins to walk around in circles, trying to sniff the scent out somewhere else. Cut to overhead view. Cut to closer view of the group as Nyla returns to June and continues sniffing. Cut to frontal view as Nyla lies back down and covers his nose.


Zuko

[Frontal view.] Well, what does that mean?


June

[Frontal view. Petting Nyla.] Means your friend's gone.


Toph

[Frontal view.] We know he's gone. That's why we're trying to find him.


June

[Close-up as June stands up.] No, I mean he's gone gone. [Turns to face everyone else.] He doesn't exist.




Cut to the others as the look on with worry and confusion. The camera cuts to a mysterious island. Cut inside the forestry as Momo is chasing a squirrel creature in a tree. Camera pans across the branch as Momo chases the squirrel and Aang is seen walking around.


Aang

Where are we, Momo? [Cut to view of the sky through the trees as dragonflies fly past. The camera pans down as Aang speaks.] Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? [Cut to frontal view of Aang stepping under a branch.] But wait. You can see me. [Momo approaches on the branch. Cut to a close-up of Momo.] We could both be in the Spirit World. [Cut back to Aang. He uses airbending and the camera pans across as he moves.] Nope. My bending works. [Momo lands on him. Points to the hilltop. Cut to path up a hill. Camera pans up as Aang talks.] Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are.




Cut to close-up of Sokka.


Sokka

[To June.] What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? [Side-view of the group.] Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?


June

[Frontal view as she pets Nyla.] Nope. We could find him if he were dead. Wow, it's a real head-scratcher. See ya. [Cut to a wide-view of the group as she starts climbing on top of Nyla.]


Toph

[Sarcastically.] Helpful. Real helpful.


Zuko

[To June.] Wait. I have another idea. [Frontal view.] There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample.




Cut to close-up of a sandal that Zuko holds up. Camera zooms out quickly to show the members of Team Avatar are holding their noses in disgust, except for Zuko and Toph. Zuko looks embarrassed.


Sokka

You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh! [Pinches nose even tighter.]


Toph

[Smiles.] I think it's kind of sweet.




Cut to June as Nyla jumps forward. Cut to side-view of Zuko and Nyla as the latter sniffs the sandal.


June

[Frontal view. Determined.] Let's do this. [Cut to wide-view as she and Nyla run off.]


Zuko

Hey! Wait up!




They all quickly get on Appa. Cut to behind Appa as his tail hits the ground he takes off in the same direction. Cut to side-view of Nyla running up a hill as Appa flies behind. Fade to a shot behind Nyla as he jumps over a cliff edge. Camera pans to the right slightly as Appa follows closely behind. Fade to frontal view of Nyla running along with Appa close behind before Nyla jumps forward toward the camera. Cut to wide-view of Appa and Nyla approaching the destroyed Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se. Cut to frontal view of the wall as Nyla jumps in front of the camera and the camera pans up to show Appa above. Cut to close-up aerial view. The camera pans out as the group stops near the rubble. Appa lands and Nyla starts digging at the wreckage.


Zuko

We're going to Ba Sing Se?


June

[Cut to side-view of the group as Nyla continues scratching the wall.] Your uncle's somewhere beyond the wall. [Nyla stops digging and walks away.] Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. [Close-up.] Good luck.




Cut to side-view of Zuko as Nyla and June leave and he turns to watch. As they disappear over the hill he turns away to the others.


Zuko

It's been a long day. [Aerial view. Camera zooms out.] Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.




Cut back to the island. The camera pans down from trees to Aang and Momo as they approach a strange, flat rock-formation. Cut to a frontal view of Aang looking at the rock-formation. Cut to an aerial view of the entire clearing as Aang steps on to it.


Aang

It's a hexagon. [Cut to Aang's feet as Momo jumps off his shoulder. Bends down to place a hand on the ground.] It doesn't seem like normal rock. [Stands back up. Cut to a side-view as he attempts earthbending, but nothing happens.] It's not made of earth. [Sits down.] This is so strange. [Frontal view of Aang with Momo in the foreground, his back to the camera.] I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. [Suddenly realizes something.] I do have Roku! [Takes a deep breath and starts meditating. Fade to close-up of Aang. Cut to side-view as Momo runs off and the spirit of Avatar Roku appears before Aang.]


Avatar Roku

You're right, Aang. [Close-up.] All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom, is available to you [Cut to close-up of Aang.] if you look deep inside yourself.


Aang

[Looking around.] So where am I, Roku? What is this place?


Avatar Roku

[Side-view.] I ... don't know, Aang. [Close-up of Aang.] But I see you are lost in more ways than one right now.


Aang

I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.




The camera cuts to Appa. The camera pans to the right to show Zuko, Katara, Suki, and Sokka asleep on Appa's legs and tail. Cut to Toph, who is sleeping in an earth tent. She suddenly senses something and wakes up. Cut to outside her rock tent as it begins to low. The camera zooms out as the group is surrounded by a wall of fire. Cut to an aerial view of the area showing Team Avatar is trapped. Cut behind the group as the camera pans across to left. The group turn and look up to see Piandao, Jeong Jeong, Pakku, and Bumi. The camera zooms in on Piandao before panning to left to focus on Jeong Jeong, before panning again to Pakku, and finally to Bumi.


Bumi

Well, look who's here! [Starts laughing and snorting.]




Cut to Team Avatar looking confused, except for Katara and Sokka, who are both excited.
The scene changes back to the island, which now looks somewhat invisible from the outside. Cut to side-view of Aang on the island, talking to Avatar Roku's spirit.



Aang

Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, [Side-view.] but I just don't know if I can do that.


Avatar Roku

[Frontal view.] In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy. [Fade to a flashback of Sozin, close-up shot. Sozin moves forward and the camera cuts to a side-view of him attempting to attack Roku from behind. The camera pans left to show the flames engulf Roku. Cut to a shot inside the flames as they dissipate to reveal Roku gone. Fade to a close-up shot of Sozin from behind looking at his army. Fade to a panning shot of air temples on fire. Overlaid shot of close-up Sozin.] If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started. [Cut back to side-view of Aang and Roku.] I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive. [Cut behind Roku as he vanishes. Cut close-up to Aang, disappointed.]




Cut back to Outer Walls of Ba Sing Se. Wide shot of the entire group now joined by the masters.


Toph

[Confused.] What's going on? [Cut to closer view from behind the masters.] We're surrounded by old people.


Katara

Not just any old people. [Walks up to Pakku. Side-view of the masters.] These are great masters and friends of ours. [Camera pans and zooms in on Katara and Pakku as she bows to Pakku.] Pakku.


Pakku

[Bows back.] It is respectful to bow to an old master, [Frontal view. Extends his arms out.] but how about a hug for your new grandfather?


Katara

[Frontal view. Surprised and overjoyed, as is Sokka behind her.] That's so exciting! [Frontal view of Pakku as she hugs Pakku.] You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!


Pakku

I made her a new betrothal necklace and everything.


Sokka

[Runs up and hugs Pakku. Camera zooms in on Pakku.] Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!


Pakku

[Gently pushes Sokka away; slightly annoyed.] You can still just call me Pakku.


Sokka

[Frontal view.] How about Grand-Pakku?


Pakku

[Close-up. Not amused.] No. [Side-view of Zuko and Pakku as Sokka walks away behind Katara sadly. Camera zooms out to show Jeong Jeong.]


Katara

[Zuko walks up to Jeong Jeong.] And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.


Jeong Jeong

[Close-up. Bows.] Jeong Jeong.


Sokka

[Side-view. Bows to Piandao.] Master Piandao.


Piandao

[Bows back.] Hello, Sokka.


Suki

[Cut to over-head view from behind the masters.] So wait. How do you all know each other?


Bumi

[Close-up side-view.] All old people know each other. Don't you know that? [Laughs and snorts.]


Piandao

We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the four nations.


Zuko

[Frontal view.] The Order of the White Lotus.


Bumi

[Frontal view of Piandao and Jeong Jeong. Bumi slides in front of the camera.] That's the one. [Slides off camera.]


Jeong Jeong

The White Lotus has always been about philosophy and beauty and truth. [Aerial view.] But about a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important.


Pakku

[Cut close-up behind Zuko with Pakku and Katara in the background. To Zuko.] It came from a Grand Lotus: your uncle, [Close-up of Zuko.] Iroh of the Fire Nation. [Zuko smiles.]


Toph

[Camera zooms out to show Toph behind Zuko.] Well, that's who we're looking for.


Piandao

[Frontal view.] Then we'll take you to him.


Bumi

[Appears behind Piandao and Jeong Jeong and pushes them out of the way.] Wait! Someone's missing from your group. [Walks up to the camera.] Someone very important. [Walks right up to the camera.] Where's Momo?


Sokka

[Side-view. Leaning backward almost all the way, as Bumi is right in his face.] He's gone. [Pauses.] And so is Aang.


Bumi

[Camera zooms out.] Oh well. [Pats Sokka on the chest, which causes him to almost fall back.] So long as they have each other, I'm sure we have nothing to worry about. Let's go! [Slams in to the ground. Cut to underneath Bumi as he launches himself away using earthbending while laughing and snorting.]




Cut back on the island. Cut to Momo behind a branch before flying off. Cut to frontal view of Aang who is meditating as Momo arrives next to him.


Aang

Avatar Kyoshi. I need your wisdom.




Momo runs off. Fade to close-up of Aang. Side-view as the spirit of Avatar Kyoshi appears before him and the camera pans right to where she sits.


Kyoshi

In my day, [Flashback to frontal view of Chin the Conqueror. Cut to close-up of Avatar Kyoshi.] Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the world out of balance. [Kyoshi enters the Avatar State briefly and begins to earthbend. Cut to wide shot as a dust cloud appears as she separates the land.] I stopped him. [Cut to side-view of Kyoshi as she uses airbending to push the land apart.] And the world entered a great era of peace. [Cut to aerial view of the land separating.]


Aang

[Voice-over; Side-view of Chin as he falls to his death.] You didn't really kill Chin. [Camera cuts back to close-up view looking up at Aang.] Technically, he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way.


Kyoshi

[Close-up side-view.] Personally, I don't really see the difference, but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin. [Frontal view.] I offer you this wisdom, Aang: Only justice will bring peace. [Vanishes.]


Aang

[Close-up. Disappointed. Side-view as he leans back.] I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.




Cut back to the rest of the group as the camera pans right to show the group walking with the White Lotus members to their campsite.


Sokka

So, Bumi ... [Cut closer, side-view. Camera follows them as they walk.] how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?


Bumi

Escape? I didn't escape. Everybody else escaped. [Close-up.] There I was back in Omashu, [Flashback of Omashu while under control of the Fire Nation during the Day of Black Sun.] waiting for just the right moment. [Cut to close-up of Bumi suspended in a metal box.] I didn't know what or when, but I knew I'd know it when I knew it. [Camera pans round as he looks up to see the solar eclipse. Speaking in flashback.] An eclipse. That'll do it.




Cut close-up as he begins twitching his face. Cut to buildings beginning to crumble and break. Cut back to Bumi in the cage as the camera zooms in with pieces of earth heading to the cage. Frontal view of the cage as Bumi uses the broken pieces of the buildings to break himself free. Cut to the ground below as Bumi drops down and firebenders quickly show up to confront him.


Firebender

What do you think you're doing? [Zooms in on the firebender.]




The firebenders attempt to blast Bumi, but are powerless due to the eclipse. They look at Bumi in horror. Cut to frontal view of Bumi, who smiles evilly.


Bumi

Taking back my city! You've got no firepower. And it's payback time!




Bumi launches himself forward. Cut behind Bumi as he launches himself off the platform. Frontal view of Bumi as he lands. He uses earthbending and lifts a large piece of earth up. Cut to side-view of a building being separated by the pillar of earth. Cut back to Bumi, and back to the building as he moves the building with the use of the pillar. Cut to frontal view of firebenders running away. Camera pans up to reveal entire buildings beginning to move. Cut to Bumi running to left and stops to earthbend again sending more buildings flying. Cut to wide-view of Omashu. Cut to side-view of the entrance to Omashu as Fire Nation soldiers flee. 
Cut to frontal view of Bumi who turns and looks back to see a giant statue of Fire Lord Ozai. Frontal view of Bumi as he uses earthbending to stop oncoming Fire Nation soldiers. He sends small pieces of earth flying forward. Cut to close-up of the statues face as two small pillars become embedded in the eyes. Two more smaller ones go into the nostrils and large chunks go in the mouth and cheeks. Cut to side-view of the base of the statue as it begins to shift and rise. Cut to close-up of Bumi who struggles to lift the statue. Cut to a wide shot of Omashu looking up at the statue as it begins to fall over. The statue slides down toward the camera. Cut to wide side-view of Omashu's entrance as the statue falls over the side and breaks the bridge before falling in to the canyon below. Cut to close-up view of Bumi looking down at his handiwork and he begins to laugh. He starts eating a piece of jennamite before the camera cuts back to a frontal view of present-day Bumi.



Suki

[Amazed.] Wow! You took back your whole city all by yourself!


Bumi

[Side-view of entire group.] So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse?




Side-view of Sokka and Zuko, who look at each other.


Zuko

[Nonchalantly.] Nah.


Sokka

[Nonchalantly.] No, not really.




The camera cuts to close-up of Aang, who is becoming irritated.


Aang

I need to look deep inside myself.




Close-up frontal view as Aang starts meditating. Side-view of Aang as the spirit of Avatar Kuruk, a male Avatar from the Northern Water Tribe, appears before him.


Kuruk

[Close-up.] I am Avatar Kuruk. [Cut to flashback to a close-up view of a younger Avatar Kuruk. The camera zooms out to show him surfing.] When I was young, I was always a go-with-the-flow kind of Avatar. [The camera pans round to follow his movements on the wave before holding steady as he surfs away.] People seemed to work out their own problems, and there was peace and good times in the world. [Cut to shot of the sun and the camera pans down to Kuruk with Ummi and they kiss.] But then, [Fade to a side-view of Koh in the Spirit World. Koh moves in front of the camera to reveal the face of Ummi.] I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer. [Fade back to close-up side-view of present-day Kuruk.] It was my fault. If I had been more attentive and more active, [Close-up of Aang.] I could've saved her. Aang, [Close-up of Kuruk.] you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world. [Vanishes. Frontal view of Aang, even more disappointed as he places his head in his hands.]




Cut to Outer Walls of Ba Sing Se showing the moon. The camera pans down to show the White Lotus campsite and the group approaching. Cut inside the camp as Bumi lowers a rock wall to allow entrance to the camp.


Bumi

[Stepping into the camp.] Well, here we are. Welcome to Old People Camp.


Zuko

[Side-view of Jeong Jeong, Piandao, and Pakku. As Zuko speaks, Jeong Jeong and Pakku walk off and Appa stops behind Zuko and Piandao.] Where ... where is he?


Piandao

[Points to a tent on the other side of the camp. Camera cuts and zooms in showing a tent.] Your uncle's in there, Prince Zuko.




Cut back to Zuko, who becomes worried and ashamed before walking toward the tent. Cut to Zuko from behind as he approaches the tent before stopping. Close-up of Zuko. Side-view as he sits down. Katara walks up to him.


Katara

Are you okay?


Zuko

[Frontal view.] No, I'm not okay. My uncle hates me, I know it. [Katara sits down next to him.] He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?


Katara

[Close-up side-view of Zuko.] Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?


Zuko

More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.


Katara

Then he'll forgive you. He will.




Zuko stands up. Cut to side-view of him standing at the tents entrance and he exhales deeply. He walks into the tent. Cut to an aerial view inside the tent.


Zuko

Uncle?




Close-up of Zuko as he hears snoring. Frontal view of Iroh, asleep with Zuko standing at the entrance. Close-up of Zuko as he smiles and sits down next to him. The camera cuts to the island.


Aang

[Voice-over.] All these past Avatars. [Cut to frontal view of Aang.] They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it. [Momo chitters.] You're right. Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar will understand where I'm coming from. [Close-up of Momo, who stares at him. Frontal view of Aang as Momo jumps to his other side.] I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think. [Momo chitters again; Aang becomes annoyed.] I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that.




Fade to close-up of Aang meditating. Cut back to frontal view as the spirit of Avatar Yangchen, a female Air Nomad Avatar, appears before him. Aerial view from behind Aang as Yangchen's spirit sits before him.


Yangchen

[Side-view.] I am Avatar Yangchen, young airbender.


Aang

Avatar Yangchen, [Close-up of Aang.] the monks always taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.


Yangchen

[Close-up side-view.] Yes. All life is sacred.


Aang

[Frontal view. Smiles.] I know, I'm even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever. And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense. And I've certainly never used it to take a life.


Yangchen

[Cut to behind Aang as the camera pans up to show Yangchen.] Avatar Aang, I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well, but this isn't about you. [Close-up side-view of Aang.] This is about the world.


Aang

But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free.


Yangchen

[Side-view of Aang and Yangchen. Camera pans slowly to the right.] Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment, [Close-up.] but the Avatar can never do it. Because your sole duty is to the world. Here is my wisdom for you: [Close-up of Aang. Camera zooms out.] Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world. [Yangchen's spirit vanishes.]


Aang

[Momo appears behind a tree and approaches Aang. Close-up aerial view of Aang. Sorrowfully.] I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. [Camera zooms out as Aang looks up.] I have to kill the Fire Lord.




The scene changes to an aerial view of the White Lotus camp. Cut to aerial view inside Iroh's tent. Zuko sits nearby as Iroh wakes up. Cut to frontal view of Iroh as he stretches. He glances back slightly and sees Zuko, but says nothing. Frontal view of Zuko.


Zuko

[Cut to view of Iroh from behind.] Uncle, [Cut to view of Zuko over Iroh's shoulder.] I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me. [Cut briefly to view of Iroh from behind before back to a frontal view of Zuko.] But I want you to know, [Starts to cry.] I am so, so, sorry, Uncle. I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did. I don't know how I can ever make it up to you. But I'll- [He is cut off. Cut to side-view as Iroh pulls him into a hug, while starting to cry as well. Close-up of Iroh who starts to smile. Close-up of Zuko who becomes shocked and confused.] How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me.


Iroh

[Close-up.] I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost your way.


Zuko

[Side-view of the two.] I did lose my way.


Iroh

[Releases him.] But you found it again. [Frontal view.] And you did it by yourself. [Frontal view of Zuko over Iroh's shoulder.] And I am so happy you found your way here. [Side-view. Hugs him again.]


Zuko

It wasn't that hard, Uncle. You have a pretty strong scent.




The camera zooms out before cutting to the island. A squirrel runs along a branch before cutting to an aerial view of the rock formation. Birds fly past the camera as Momo and Aang sleep on the rock formation. Cut close-up to Aang as he wakes up and yawns. The camera follows him as he sits up and notices something.


Aang

Wait. [Cut to view of "approaching" mountains.] Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger?




Cut to close-up of Aang as Momo chitters. Aang bends down and uses airbending to launch himself up. Cut to the top of a tall tree that Aang lands on. As he looks foward, Momo flies around and lands on his shoulder. Cut to a close-up of Aang and Momo. Aang turns around to show a wake behind the "island".


Aang

They're not getting larger, [Turning back. Excitedly.] They're getting closer! [Aang jumps off the tree. Cut to side-view as he runs toward the edge of the island, Momo in his wake.] The whole island is moving!




Cut to side-view of the island as Aang leaps out from the brush and jumps in to the water. Cut underwater as Aang dives down. Cut to Momo landing on a branch looking down at where Aang entered the water and chitters. Cut to side-view of Aang underwater as he swims down. Cut to a frontal view as he inspects the island. Cut to a wide-view as a paw moves past him. Cut to frontal view of Aang who hovers for a moment before swimming up to the surface. Cut to the surface of the water as Aang emerges, gasping for breath, and Momo lands nearby.


Aang

It's amazing Momo! The biggest animal in the world! I've gotta to swim around and find its face. [Momo chitters in response and he swims off toward the front of the "island". Momo follows him.]




Cut to an aerial view of Momo flying above Aang, who is swimming in the water below. Cut to a distance view of the entire island from behind. Cut to aerial view of the White Lotus camp.


Zuko

[Voice-over.] Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar who can [Side-view of Iroh with Zuko sat next to him. Toph sits to Zuko's right and Katara has her back to the camera opposite Toph.] possibly defeat the Father Lord.


Toph

You mean the Fire Lord.


Zuko

[Angrily.] That's what I just said!


Iroh

Hmmm ...


Zuko

We need you to come with us!


Iroh

[Close-up.] No, Zuko, it won't turn out well.


Zuko

[Aerial view of the group.] You can beat him! [Turns to the others.] And we'll be there to help.


Iroh

Even if I did defeat Ozai, [Close-up.] and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war. [Aerial view of the group.] History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.


Zuko

[Close-up of Zuko from over Iroh's shoulder.] And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?


Iroh

[Close-up.] No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart [Frontal view from the side of Iroh as the camera zooms in on Zuko.] and unquestionable honor. It has to be you, Prince Zuko.


Zuko

[Zuko briefly looks away.] Unquestionable honor? But I've made so many mistakes.


Iroh

Yes, you have. [Close-up of Iroh from over Zuko's shoulder.] You've struggled; you've suffered, but you have always followed your own path. [Close-up of Zuko.] You restored your own honor, and only you can restore the honor of the Fire Nation.


Zuko

[Zuko looks away.] I'll try, Uncle.


Toph

[Side-view of Toph.] Well, what if Aang doesn't come back?


Iroh

[Aerial view of group.] Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord. [Extreme close-up.] When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se. [Cut to Zuko and the camera pans across to right showing Toph, Sokka, Suki, and Katara.] Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation, [Extreme close-up.] so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.


Suki

[Side-view of Suki and Katara.] That's why you gathered the members of the White Lotus.


Iroh

Yes. [Close-up from over Zuko's shoulder.] Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order. [Extreme close-up of Zuko.] But Azula will be there, waiting for you.


Zuko

I can handle Azula.


Iroh

Not alone! [Frontal view of Iroh from the side of Zuko.] You'll need help.


Zuko

[Extreme close-up.] You're right. Katara, [Frontal view of Katara over Zuko's shoulder.] how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?


Katara

It would be my pleasure.


Sokka

What about us? [Side-view of Toph with Sokka sitting to the right and behind.] What is our destiny today?


Iroh

[Close-up.] What do you think it is?


Sokka

[Frontal view.] I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.


Toph

[Camera pans back and to the left to Toph.] And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us. [Close-up of Iroh, who smiles.]




Cuts to side-view of Toph and Suki on board an eel hound. The camera zooms out to show the entire eel hound and Sokka and Piandao are on the ground beside it.


Piandao

Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel hound. [Frontal view of Piandao with Sokka's back to the camera. Piandao hands Sokka a map, who examines it.] The air ship base is on a small island just off the Earth Kingdom shore. [Frontal view of Sokka over the shoulder of Piandao.] You should be able to intercept the fleet within a day's journey.


Sokka

[He puts the map away.] Thank you, Master.




Cut to frontal view as they bow to each other before Sokka hugs Piandao. Camera pans right to Appa, with Zuko up front and Katara in the saddle.


Zuko

[To Iroh.] So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, [Side-view of Zuko.] what are you going to do?


Iroh

[Frontal view.] After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day. [Flips a Pai Sho piece and catches it as he speaks.]




Cut to close-up of Zuko with Katara, in the background, as they both look left. Cut to Sokka, Toph, and Suki looking back and Sokka nods. Cuts to a aerial shot of the entire group.


Katara

Goodbye, General Iroh.


Iroh

[Close-up.] Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. [Whispers.] I know it.




Cut to aerial view as the eel hound sets off followed soon after by Appa. The camera pans up slightly as the Order of the White Lotus members wave. Cuts back to the side of the island, now close to the mountains. Cut to the top of the trees on the island and the camera pans down to Aang swimming in the water. Aang stops and Momo chitters behind him as he dives in the water. Cut underwater as Aang swims to the front of the island to take a closer look. Cut to frontal view of Aang and the camera pans down to follow him as he swims. He stops and an eye opens behind him. Cut to frontal view of a surprised Aang and he swims back as a giant paw moves underneath him and lifts him up. Cut to above the water as Aang and the paw emerge. A wave of water covers the camera view before falling down to reveal a face. The camera cuts and zooms out to show the entire creature as Aang stands on it's paw.


Aang

[Side-view.] A lion turtle! [Frontal view. Bows to it. Frontal view of Lion turtle.] Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life. [Frontal view.] But I don't know if I can do it.


Lion turtle

[Frontal view of the lion turtle's face from behind Aang. The lion turtle's mouth is not moving, yet it is speaking to Aang.] The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. [Extreme close-up of left eye.] Since beginning-less time, [Side-view of the lion turtle as it lifts it's other paw out of the water and moves it toward Aang.] darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light.




The lion turtle placed two claws on Aang, one on his forehead and the other on his chest, and a bright light issues forth from it. Fade to side-view of the lion turtle's paw as it moves slowly toward a small cliff in the Earth Kingdom, and Aang steps off onto dry land. Momo flies onto Aang's shoulder. Cut to frontal view of the lion turtle from behind Aang.


Lion turtle

Wait for him. He will come.




Aang bows to the lion turtle. The lion turtle sinks under the water. Frontal view of Aang as he stands up out of the bow. Cut to wide-view of the lion turtle swimming away. Cut to frontal view of Aang, who leaps off-camera. Cut to a wide-view of Ozai's base.


Ozai

[Close-up.] It's time for this world to end in fire, and for a new world to be born from the ashes.




Camera backs up as he speaks revealing his airship fleet. Cut to the comet, which enters Earth's atmosphere. Cut back to behind Ozai, before panning right fading to Aang and Momo from behind in a different location. Cut to a frontal view of Aang. Cuts to close-up of the comet, followed by a close-up of Aang's face with the comet behind him on the horizon. Fade to credits.



The episode opens to where Sozin's Comet can be seen skimming the atmosphere of the Earth. Zuko and Katara are flying on Appa briskly through the orange colored sky. Katara turns to Zuko upon seeing his worried and somewhat anxious expression.


Katara

Zuko, don't worry. We can take Azula.


Zuko

It's not her I'm worried about. I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father? What if he loses?


Katara

[Somewhat confidently.] Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. [Looks forward with narrowed eyes.]  He has to. [Close-up of Zuko's face as he follows Katara's lead and looks forward.]




Cut to the Royal Palace, where Azula is being groomed by her servants in preparation for her coronation. She takes a cherry from a bowl one of her servants is holding and pops it into her mouth, only to spit out a pit in disgust.


Azula

[Holding a cherry pit in her hand.] What am I holding?


Banished servant

A cherry pit, Princess.


Azula

Correct. And what day is this?


Banished servant

It is the day of your coronation.


Azula

Yes, it is. So, please. Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry? [Throws the pit at the servant, who winces slightly from the impact.]


Banished servant

It wasn't a decision; it was just a small mistake.


Azula

Small? Do you realize what could've happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?


Banished servant

[Nervously.] I suppose you could've ... choked?


Azula

Yes, then you will understand the severity of your crime.


Banished servant

I understand, Princess. Please, forgive me.


Azula

Oh very well, since it is a special day, I will show mercy. You are banished. Leave this palace immediately.




The servant bows and quietly walks away.


Azula

What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes. I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.




Scene cuts to where an eel hound is swimming through the water, Sokka, Toph, and Suki riding atop the beast.


Suki

It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.


Toph

Too bad the Fire Lord's about to use it to destroy the world.




The eel hound arrives at the shore of the airship base. The trio climbs their way up a cliff side only to discover the fleet has just taken off.


Sokka

We're too late! The fleet's already taking off!


Toph

Then we're taking off, too! Where's the closest airship?


Sokka

It's right ... [Points to the closest airship.]




He is interrupted as Toph launches the three toward an airship, using earthbending. After a swift ascension, they fall onto a nearby ship and make their way across the giant vessel. The camera zooms out and focuses on the lead airship, Fire Lord Ozai standing on the very ledge overlooking the land. The scene switches to where Azula is sitting impatiently on her throne as a band of Dai Li agents approaches.


Head of Dai Li

You sent for us, Princess. Is everything all right?


Azula

Actually, everything's not all right! Do you know how long it took you to get here?


Head of Dai Li

Uh ... a few minutes, I guess.


Azula

Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!


Head of Dai Li

My apologies, Princess.


Azula

Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty?


Head of Dai Li

The Dai Li would never betray you!


Azula

And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me! [Hesitates for a moment.] You're all banished!


Head of Dai Li

But ...


Azula

Goodbye!




The agent pauses briefly before turning around and exiting the room followed by the other Dai Li agents behind him.


Azula

Please send in the next group on your way out! [Looks menacingly.]




Meanwhile, back on the airship, the trio has made their way to the main control room.


Sokka

[Backed against the wall.] Sshhh ...




Toph approaches the door and knocks several times before breaking it down. Using metalbending, she creates a suit of armor from the door and assaults the astonished crew members. The Fire Nation soldiers launch firebending attacks at her, but she merely dodges them and metalbends various parts of the ship's interior to imprison the crew members. With all the men defeated, Sokka and Suki peer into the room. Toph takes off her suit of armor.


Toph

That's how it's done!


Sokka

Good work, Toph! Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel.


Toph

[Sarcastically.] That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship!


Sokka

I was talking to Suki.


Toph

That would make a lot more sense.


Suki

[Approaches the steering wheel.] What are we going to do about the rest of the crew?


Sokka

Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea. [Grabs a tube-like speaker.] Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate.




Suki begins to steer the ship close to the water. In the bomb bay, the crew members are standing around, waiting.


Qin Lee

[To a nearby engineer.] Hey, I'm Qin Lee. I work up in communications.


Engineer

Oh, hi. I work down in the engine room. That's probably why we never met before. Big airship, you know?


Qin Lee

Yep.


Engineer

So, do you know whose birthday it is?




A crew member approaches Qin Lee and the engineer.


Crew member

I can't believe the captain remembered my birthday. He really does care.




The bomb bay doors open and all the crew members fall into the ocean. The crew members swim up for air.


Engineer

[To the crew member.] Happy birthday. [He frowns at him.]




Back up into the cabin, Sokka looks through a broken window at Ozai's airship.


Sokka

Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.




Sokka grabs the throttle and pushes it forward. Cut to a shot of Ozai. Scene changes to the Fire Nation royal palace. Cut to a shot of Azula at the throne, looking left just as footsteps are heard. Cut to a shot of Lo and Li walking toward the throne.


Li

[To Azula.] Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your servants?


Lo

All your Dai Li agents ...


Li

And the Imperial Firebenders?


Azula

None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.


Lo and Li

Azula, we are concerned for you and your well-being.


Azula

[Glaring at Lo and Li.] My father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't he‌? He thinks I can't handle the responsibility of being Fire Lord. But I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history.


Lo

I'm sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today ...


Li

Perhaps it's best if you postponed your coronation.


Azula

[In anger, glaring at Lo and Li.] What? Which one of you just said that?




Lo and Li point at each other.


Azula

What a shame ... there's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai!


Lo

But ...


Lo and Li

We're not firebenders.


Azula

All right, fine. [Pointing at Li.] Lo, you're banished. [Pointing at Lo, while actually talking to Li.] Li, you can stay. [Walks away.]


Li

But, I'm Li. So who's banished?




Lo shrugs at Li. The scene changes to Ba Sing Se as Fire Nation tanks roll toward the main gate. Cut to a shot of the main gate as the tanks line up. Cut to the flag of the Order of the White Lotus. Cut to a shot of Jeong Jeong, Bumi, Pakku, and Piandao from the side.


Bumi

Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.


Pakku

Here to set you free.


Iroh

[Cut to a shot of Iroh.] Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.




Iroh inhales deeply. Cut to a shot of the Sozin's Comet. Scene changes back to Iroh exhaling as a ring of fire appears around. The flames grow larger each time Iroh breathes deeply. Iroh opens his eyes and raises his arms, as the flames around him collect to make a ball of fire. It collects energy and Iroh fires it as a massive fire blast that breaches the Outer Wall. Cut to a shot of the Order. Bumi jumps forward and stomps the ground. The three stone blocks that the Order's members are standing on begin to quickly move toward Ba Sing Se. Cut to a shot from behind the wall as fire blasts are shot at the Order members. Cut to a shot of Iroh deflecting the attacks. The Order members leap and go toward the city.
Cut to a shot of an alleyway. Pakku bends a giant wave of water over the building and down toward the Fire Nation soldiers. Cut to a shot of Piandao as he jumps over it. Pakku turns the wave into ice, freezing the soldiers. Piandao slides down the frozen wave and slashes the ends of the soldier's weapons. Sliding into another street, Pakku unfreezes the water, freezes it again in front of him to block an incoming fire blast. The ice barrier is destroyed, and when another fire blast is about to hit Pakku, a giant wall of fire erupts, made by Jeong Jeong, in front of him, stopping the attack.
Cut to a short of Jeong Jeong, floating in the air using firebending to create fire jets beneath his feet. Jeong Jeong turns to another street. A line of tanks fire on him, but he blocks the attacks with another giant wall of fire and thrusts the wall knocking the tanks. More tanks begin to fire on him from another street, but Jeong Jeong repeats his actions, creating a wall of flame and attacking the tanks with it. The tanks can be seen knocked over and in a pile as the wall of fire pushes another tank into the pile.
Scene changes to Azula standing in front of a full length mirror. She takes a ribbon and begins leisurely winding around her hair. Her hand gets caught as she is tying her hair into a top knot. Frustrated, she tugs at the tangled mess a few times before she grabs a pair of scissors from the table next to her, ready to cut her hair.



Azula

All right hair, it's time to face your doom.




Azula grabs the bangs hanging in front of her face. She lifts them in the air and cuts them, with them falling near her feet. Her reflection in the mirror shows her grinning, with her hair a mess, but she stops grinning as she notices Ursa appears in the reflection, behind Azula.


Ursa

What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair.


Azula

What are you doing here‌?


Ursa

I didn't want to miss my own daughter's coronation.


Azula

Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster.


Ursa

[Cuts to shot of Azula looking at her reflection in the mirror, clearly angered; off-camera.] I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people, like your friends Mai and Ty Lee.


Azula

[Closes her eyes before turning around sharply to face her mother.] Well what choice do I have?! [Cuts to shot of her standing in the room, her back to the mirror which still shows the reflection of her mother.] Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.


Ursa

[Sincerely.] No. I love you, Azula. I do.




Cuts to close-up of Azula as she bends over slightly, tears in her eyes, and her hair hanging down in messy locks. Cuts to shot of her hand gripped around a hairbrush on the table. The camera shifts as the enraged princess lets out a shout and hurls the brush at the mirror. The resulting impact shatters a large portion of the mirror, including where Ursa's reflection was seen. Cuts to overhead shot of the room as Azula kneels over and begins bitterly crying. The room is devoid of any other people, showing that Ursa's reflection was a mere hallucination.
Cut to a shot of the approaching Fire Nation fleet of airships. Cut to a shot of Ozai from behind, standing at the front of his airship. Cut to a shot of Ozai from the front as he inhales deeply. He exhales, opens his eyes and smiles. Cut to a shot of Ozai's airship from above. The airship that Sokka, Suki, and Toph hijacked can be seen just below it. Cut to a shot of Ozai's airship from Sokka's point of view as he looks through a small glass.



Sokka

We're not gonna catch up to him in time.


Suki

[Sadly.] No ...




Cut to a shot of Ozai from above. Scene changes to a shot of the comet before changing back to Ozai. He tilts his head back and smiles sadistically. Ozai raises his arms in the air, pulls his palm down toward the ground beneath. A small but incredibly intense flame is forming on his hand, growing larger until it is finally fired into an enormous fire blast that ignites the earth below. Cut to a shot of Ozai, as he burns the ground with a sadistic grin. Cut to a shot from behind Ozai. Cut to a shot from behind a tall, stone pillar where Aang is standing, facing Ozai's assault. Cut to a closer shot of Aang from behind. Seated on Aang's shoulder, Momo chirps.


Aang

Momo, time for you to go.




Momo leaps off of Aang's shoulder. Aang closes his eyes and breathes deeply. Aang performs several spinning kicks, using earthbending to send giant sections of the stone pillar beneath him toward Ozai's ship and jumps to another pillar. The chunks of rock whistle past the side of Ozai's airship, which catches his notice. The last few pieces of rock strike the airship's engine, which causes Ozai to lose balance and stop his attack. Cut to a shot from the side of the airship as smoke drifts from the engine. It loses power and begins to descend. Ozai looks down to see Aang. Aang spins his body around, gathering his energy, and unleashes a huge fire blast at Ozai's ship, striking the final blow to its engine, thereby destroying the airship.
Aang turns to the side toward the airship and it floats past him, facing Ozai for the first time. Ozai stares at Aang with surprise. Aang can be seen standing on top of a stone pillar in the distance. Cut to a close-up of Aang facing Ozai, as he lowers his bending stance. Cut to a shot of Ozai, as he removes his Phoenix King armor and cloak, burning it and leaving his chest bare. Ozai jumps off of the platform he is standing on, using his firebending to fly like a rocket toward Aang. Cut to a shot of Aang until the top of another stone pillar comes into view, which Ozai lands on. Cut to a shot of Ozai, with his airship smoldering behind him.
Cut to a shot of the burning airship from Sokka's view through a glass. Cut to a shot of Suki, Sokka, and Toph inside the airship cabin.



Suki

What just happened‌?


Sokka

[Excited.] It's Aang! He's back!




Cut to a shot of Aang. Zooms in. The camera cuts and pans up to show Aang and Ozai facing each other. Zooms in on Aang.


Ozai

After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now the universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.


Aang

Please listen to me. We don't have to fight. You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.


Ozai

You are right. I do have the power. I have all the power in the world!




Ozai begins to shoot fire from his hands and mouth. The camera zooms out. Cut to a shot of Aang as he enters his battle stance. Cut to a shot of Ozai as the flames die, and he looks at Aang. Ozai jumps, spins in the air, and slams his fist downward, creating a circular wave of flames that spread directly toward Aang. Aang jumps over the attack and slams his hands and feet into the stone pillar right below him. He earthbends a piece of the pillar he is holding into the air. Aang rotates it around and kicks the chunk of rock toward Ozai, who leaps away using his firebending. In mid-air, Ozai propels himself at Aang using a jet of fire from his feet. At the same time, Aang jumps toward Ozai, sending a wave of fire at him. Ozai kicks forward and shoots a fire blast from his foot. The two attacks collide in a fiery explosion. The camera pulls back through the broken window of the airship cabin where Sokka, Suki, and Toph are.


Sokka

[Excited.] Go, Aang! Airbending slice! [Swings hand down, slicing through the air.]


Suki

Shouldn't we be helping him?


Sokka

The Fire Lord is Aang's fight. We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.


Toph

[Sarcastically.] And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang? [Normal.] I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal.


Sokka

[Smiles as he comes up with his idea before turning to face Suki and Toph; excitedly.] Airship slice!




The scene cuts to a shot of Toph and Suki, as Suki raises her eyebrow at Sokka. Cut to a shot of the airship they are piloting. It begins to rise higher and higher into the air. Cut to a shot of Sokka at the wheel as he begins to pull some levers. Cut to a shot of the airship from outside. Cut back to a shot of Sokka as he spins the wheel to his left. Cut back to the shot of the airship outside as it banks toward the left end of the airship fleet behind it. Cut to a shot from the side of the airship fleet. Firebenders are seen standing on platforms jutting out toward the front. In unison, they begin to firebend. Cut to a shot from below as the fire blasts hit the ground below. Cut to a shot high above the airships. The fire burns and creates an immense amount of smoke. Cut to a shot of the forest as it is engulfed in flames. Cut to a shot of the torrents of flame from the side before cutting to a shot of Toph, looking down at the chaos through the cabin's shattered window.


Toph

Whoa. That's a lot of fire, isn't it.




Cut to a close-up of Toph's face, before cutting to a shot of the airship as it flies toward the camera. Cut to a shot of the inside of the cabin, Sokka at the wheel. He spins the wheel back around as their airship comes to face the side of the airship fleet. He pulls more levers, steadying the ship. Cut to a close-up of Sokka pulling a lever down. The scene cuts to a close-up of a dial, its needle turning to the maximum. Cut to a shot of the exhaust pipes of the airship, smoke begins to billow out. Cut to a shot of the airship's engine from outside as it begins to rupture and explode. Cut to a close-up of Sokka, gritting his teeth in determination.


Sokka

It's gonna be a rough ride! We need to get to the top of this thing, fast.




Sokka grabs Toph's hand, and they run to the exit. Suki's following not too far behind. Sokka and Suki stop at the doorway, as Toph continues running on.


Suki

[Responding to Sokka's last comment.] Then what?


Sokka

Watch each other's backs, and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.




Suki and Sokka share a quick kiss before going on, catching up with Toph. The scene cuts from them to a shot of the airship as it begins to descend. It plows into other airships, causing a domino-effect of crashing. Cut to a shot from above the trio. As they climb their way up a ladder to the top of the airship. The floor beneath them suddenly gets destroyed as soon as Sokka got up the ladder; they had just made it. Cut to a shot of the top of the airship as the three of them climb out through a hatch on top. Sokka grabs Toph's hand to guide her, and the three of them begin running toward the front of the ship. The camera quickly zooms out to show the airship still flying through the fleet, but slowly demolishing itself in process. The scene cuts to a shot of Toph, Sokka, and Suki, racing toward the front of the airship. Suddenly, just as they are getting to their destination, part of the airship falls off, separating Suki from Toph and Sokka. Cut to a shot of a horrified Suki as she reaches out to the others, and pulls away from the camera. The scene switches back to Sokka and Toph. Their piece of airship is drifting away from Suki's.


Sokka

Suki!




The scene cuts to a shot of above the airship; the front breaks off and collides with one last enemy ship. Cut to a shot from behind Sokka, reaching out desperately to Suki in front of him. Suki jumps from what is left of their airship, and down to another one.


Suki

I'm okay! Just finish the mission!


Sokka

[Heartbroken.] No ... ‌


Toph

Sokka, I think we've gotta ...


Toph and Sokka

Jump!




Cut to a shot of the front of the airship, slamming violently into another enemy airship. Cut to a shot of Toph and Sokka as they land below, onto another airship. Sokka covers Toph to shade her from falling debris.
Cut to the plaza, the location of the Fire Lord's coronation. The scene cuts to the front of Azula, who is kneeling down on the plaza steps. She is seen wearing Fire Lord robes with her armor underneath. Standing behind her are Fire Sages, one begins to hold the headpiece over her head.



Fire Sage

By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord ...




The sage suddenly pauses and looks ahead. Azula turns her head to face him.


Azula

[Somewhat annoyed.] What are you waiting for? Do it!




Appa is heard in the distance off-camera, and Azula turns back around to see Appa landing in the plaza courtyard. The scene cuts to a frontal shot of Appa; Katara is seated on Appa's saddle, and Zuko is standing on his back.


Zuko

Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today. [Jumps off Appa.] I am.


Azula

[Laughs.] You're hilarious.


Katara

[Jumps off of Appa to stand beside Zuko.] And you're going down.




The Fire Sage is just about to crown Azula the new Fire Lord, regardless of what Katara and Zuko have just said, until Azula signals with her hand for him to stop.


Azula

Wait. You want to be Fire Lord? Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!


Zuko

[Seriously.] You're on.




Katara turns to face Zuko, very surprised. The scene cuts to Azula's lips as they form into a sly smile, before cutting back to Katara and Zuko.


Katara

What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.


Zuko

I know. But I can take her this time.


Katara

But even you admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.


Zuko

There's something off about her; I can't explain it but she's slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.




Katara nods as the scene fades to a shot of the courtyard from the side. The camera goes from showing Zuko kneeling on one end, to Azula kneeling on the other end of the courtyard. Cut to a shot of Zuko standing up and turning around; cut to Azula doing the same. Cut to a shot of Azula taking off her Fire Lord garments.


Azula

[Slightly sarcastic.] I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother.


Zuko

[Getting in his stance.] No you're not.




Azula smiles and assumes an awkward fighting stance. She spins and sends a sudden blast of blue fire toward Zuko. Zuko brings his hands up and jumps forward, bringing his arms down in front of him. He bends a flame in each hand and they emerge. He sends the fire toward Azula. The scene cuts to the side of the fight to show a wall of fire, blue colliding with red, take form. As the wall begins to die, Azula leaps up on a jet of fire and kicks her legs forward, sending a wave of fire from her feet during each of her three spinning kicks.
Cut to an overhead shot of the stone pillars. Aang lands on top of one, but suddenly leaps away to be blocking and pushed by a blast of fire emerging from Ozai. The Fire Lord attacks again, sending a wave of fire from a downward kick. Aang jumps to another rock to avoid the attack, and picks up a small part of the rock and sends it toward Ozai with a kick. Ozai dodges the attack by sending a blast of fire out of his foot. Aang leaps to the top of another rock to avoid the attack before leaping to land near a waterfall. Ozai follows him there, sending yet another fire blast toward Aang. Aang uses waterbending to send some of the waterfall toward the flames, extinguishing them and causing Ozai to jump back. He flies back toward Aang, using fire rockets from his feet. He shoots a large burst of fire at Aang, but Aang jumps to the top of the waterfall to avoid the attack. Ozai rockets up after him, and flips forward, shooting fire from both feet. Aang jumps to the other side of the slope to escape the hot flames.
Ozai flies over to him, using his fire jets shooting from his feet, but Aang lands on a boulder, lifting it into the air. He jumps away, only to stop Ozai for a second, distracted by the boulder. He continues to chase Aang, shooting at him with his fiery fist. Aang spins around, creating a tornado shield that blocks him from the flames. He lands on the side of a rock pillar, and quickly scoots to the other side, only to see Ozai shooting another stream of fire at him. Aang leaps to another pillar before airbending himself back to the first pillar. He kicks the top of the pillar off, sending it toward Ozai. To Aang's surprise, Ozai is right behind him, and he sends a ball of fire toward Aang.
Aang raises his hand to block himself from the surprise attack as he is pushed and hits the side of a rock, falling to the ground in pain. Ozai flies toward him again, and lands on the same ledge as Aang. Seeing that Ozai is there, Aang picks himself up, and suddenly earthbends to create rock armor around his body. Ozai shoots fists of fire at Aang, pushing him around the edge of the ledge. He swings his arm at Aang, sending a wave of fire toward him, but he jumps away leaving the rock armor behind.
Aang suddenly performs a flip backward to shoot a gust of wind at Ozai from the air. Ozai jumps aside to avoid Aang's blast, and begins to shoot lightning. Aang is grasping on to the side of a rock, seemingly terrified. Just when the lightning is about to strike him, he quickly swings his arm around to create another tornado shield. He jumps up, and flies to the top of a rock where Ozai attempts to shoot a lightning bolt at him, but misses. After the failed attempt, he continues shooting blasts at Aang, to which he lifts the top of a rock and dodges in order to evade. He suddenly rolls forward, just as Ozai sends another blast of lightning toward him.
Aang begins to redirect the lightning, pointing it toward the terrified Ozai. Aang hesitates to strike him, and so he sends the bolt into the orange sky instead. He falls to the ground, exhausted from straining to hold the energy from the lightning. Ozai smiles, sensing he has the upper-hand, and performs a spin-kick of fire toward Aang, who raises the ground to protect himself from the fire blast. He is thrown off the rock from the impact and is falling toward the water below him. The camera zooms in on his eye as he opens it and realizes he is falling.
He tilts himself up, frantically waving his arms and trying to airbend to break his fall. Seeing that does not work due to the speed he is falling, as he nears the water, he creates a funnel shape from it to land softly and gets washed up onto shore. He quickly stands up to see Ozai rocketing toward him. Cut to a shot of Ozai.





The scene cuts back to Zuko and Azula. Cut to an overhead shot of the plaza, orange and blue flames blasting toward each other. One building is shown to be on fire, and as a bright blue flame shoots past the camera, another one burns in the flames. Cut to a shot of Zuko as he punches a powerful blast of fire toward his sister. His stream of orange blends with a blast of blue fire. Cut to a shot of the side of Zuko, he continues shooting fire while being pushed back by the blue flames colliding with his. The camera zooms in on Zuko's foot as he continues to be pushed back. He turns his foot around in order to steady himself. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko, a powerful fire blast streaming from his fist.
Suddenly, Zuko and Azula stop their attacks. The scared and confused Azula turns to find that Zuko's strong attack has caused the plaza behind her to be smothered in flames. She leaps forward with a blast of fire that she swings at Zuko. Just as he is about to be hit, Zuko thrusts his palms outward to create a wall of fire that slices the blue flame. The scene cuts to an overhead shot of the flames as they slowly die down. Cut to a shot of Azula who is crouching on the ground. A profile shot of her shows that she is heavily panting, and she grits her teeth and narrows her eyes in determination.
A determined look flushes over Azula. The scene quickly cuts to a shot of Zuko's left fist. He opens it, and with the other fist punches two large fireballs toward Azula, and the fire emerges to create one massive blast. Cut to a shot of Azula's fear-filled eyes, reflecting with orange from the oncoming attack. The camera zooms out as Azula dodges using a jet of blue fire. She flies forward into the air, using jets of fire from her feet and hands. Cut to a side-shot of her as she thrusts her fists forward creating two blue fire blasts.
Zuko is shown crouching with his arms outward, blue and orange flames swirling around him. Azula is flying toward him as she swerves to the right to dodge Zuko's last blast. The scene cuts to an overhead shot of Azula as she shoots fire at Zuko and circles him, a trail of blue fire coming from her feet. Zuko quickly defends himself by creating a shield of fire for protection. He tries to attack Azula, who is still circling him, but she is too fast. The scene cuts to a close shot of Zuko. He stops firing at Azula, crouches, and begins spinning and kicking immense and powerful flames from his feet. Azula is flying forward; when she sees the attack, she tries to stop, but it is too late. Azula falls and rolls forward onto the ground. In pain, she picks herself up. A close-up of her shows that she is hunched over, her hair is undone and she is extremely angry.



Zuko

[Angrily and somewhat mockingly.] No lightning today? What's the matter? [Quickly assuming his lightning redirection stance.] Afraid I'll redirect it?


Azula

Oh, I'll show you lightning!




At that moment, Azula waves and moves her fingertips in order to generate lightning, but her stance is irregular and off. The scene cuts to a frontal shot of Zuko; inhaling and exhaling deeply. He assumes his stance and prepares to redirect whatever lightning may come his way. As he is doing so, the camera pans left to show Katara standing by as backup. Suddenly, light begins flickering as Azula begins charging her lightning. She finishes charging, and a close-up of her eyes shows she is not glancing toward Zuko, but to the left of him. The scene cuts to Zuko with Katara to his left and zooms in on Katara. Cut back to Azula, still in her stance and ready to strike; lightning at her fingertips. She smiles and extends her arm to shoot the blast directly at Katara.
The scene becomes some-what slow motion as lightning is emerging from Azula. Cut to a shot of Zuko's shocked face as he turns to the left. Zuko runs, trying to get in between Katara and the lightning. The scene zooms in on Katara's dumbfounded face and cuts to a close-up on her eyes, reflecting the impending lightning. Suddenly, Zuko jumps up, in between Katara and the lightning.



Zuko

[In slow motion as he comes in front of Katara.] No!




Zuko extends his finger out in order to redirect it, but fails in doing so, therefore absorbing it. Light flashes, and the camera cuts to a shot from behind Katara, showing Zuko in mid-air, before cutting to Katara's shocked, horrified face. The slow motion ends, and Zuko hits the ground, the lightning leaving his body through his other arm. Cut to a shot above the capital, the redirected lightning blasting into the air. Cut back to Zuko, lying on the ground, twitching from the electricity seeping through his body. He rolls onto his back, groaning and holding his wounded chest. Cut to a scared Katara as she runs in Zuko's direction.


Katara

[Yelling.] Zuko!




Zuko is shown, lying on the ground in pain. His shirt around his chest is burnt away, revealing a large scar. Katara is running toward him, but is stopped in her tracks by a blast of lightning in between her and Zuko. The scene cuts to a crazed Azula, hunched over and swaying from side to side. She suddenly starts laughing maniacally and runs forward into the camera just as the scene cuts to Ozai rocketing forward.
The shot cuts to the side of Ozai as he flies over the water below. The terrified Aang begins to swing his arms using waterbending to launch. He reaches the shore, stumbling forward, with Ozai not too far behind. Ozai reaches him, and Aang earthbends a circle of rocks around himself for protection. Ozai is right over him, laughing. The scene cuts to Aang trapped inside his sphere, bracing himself with his arms.



Ozai

You're weak, just like the rest of your people! They did not deserve to exist in this world ... in my world! Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!




The camera tilts up to show Ozai thrusting both fists into Aang's rock shield, releasing a powerful fire blast while doing so. Cut to Aang still trapped inside the rock, still shielding himself with his eyes closed as pebbles fall around him and orange light can be seen seeping in through the cracks between the rocks. Cut back to Ozai as he throws another fire blast against Aang's shield. Ozai jumps back, lands, and rises back up to the camera's level as the scene zooms in on him. It quickly zooms out as he sends two powerful fire blasts at the camera. Fade to credits.



The episode opens with a reddish shy due to Sozin's Comet as the camera pans to the left. The scene cuts to Ozai throwing a left-curved fire blast, followed with a right-curved blast. He fires a straight blast. Cuts to inside Aang's earth sphere shield as he endures the blasts.


Ozai

[Yelling out to Aang tauntingly while using a flamethrower blast with his hair swaying in the wind.] Come on out, Avatar! You can't hide in there forever!




The scene changes to the airship fleet. Sokka and Toph are running on top of one of three airships.


Sokka

Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.


Toph

Got it! [She moves Sokka out of the way, spits into her hands, and rubs them together. Toph grips and metalbends the rudder while grunting in effort, and the Imperial Firebenders inside the ship crash into the wall, and due to the action, the ship crashes into the others.]


Sokka

Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?


Toph

[Pleased.] You could stand to mention it more.




A firebender comes out of the ship and fires at Sokka and Toph. Dragging Toph along, Sokka jumps off the ship, planting his sword in the side of vessel the stop their descent. He manages to slow them down, though they still fall off and roughly land on a platform below; Sokka breaks his leg in the process, and his sword embeds itself in the metal just in front of him. Toph, however, falls off the platform, though Sokka manages to grab hold of her hand at the last moment.


Sokka

[In pain.] My leg! Hang on Toph!


Toph

Aye, aye, Captain.




Two firebenders emerge on the platforms beside them, posing a threat from two sides. As one of the soldiers is about to firebend at them, Sokka throws his boomerang at him, knocking him out. He kicks his sword in to his hand and throws it at the remaining soldier's platform; it cuts right through the metal and plummets to the forest below.


Sokka

[Sadly.] Bye, space sword.




More Imperial Firebenders come outside, ready to finish the pair.


Sokka

I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end. [Toph starts crying and the firebenders run away. The airship gets struck by a different one and Sokka lets Toph fall onto it before jumping down himself, hurting his leg again in the process. He falls over in pain.]


Toph

How did that happen? Did boomerang come back?


Sokka

[Looking up.] No, Suki did. [They see Suki riding on the last functioning airship with a triumphant smile.]




The scene changes to Aang and Ozai's battle. Ozai is still throwing fire blasts Aang. He blasts Aang a few more times and rises up to fly toward the shell to shoot an enormous, continuous blast of fire at Aang. Ozai steps back to charge another intense attack causing Aang's rock shield to be crushed and Aang protects himself with an airbending shield but is pushed back by the force of the attack, crashing into a rock pillar. The scar on his back is hit with a point of the rock, causing him to flashback to when he was shot by lightning. Cut to him during the Avatar State as Roku explains how the ability works. Cut to Kyoshi as the camera pans across revealing more Avatars, all with their eyes lit up. Cut briefly to Roku, before cutting back to the Avatar line. Cut again briefly to Aang entering the Avatar State in the catacombs, and back to the Avatar line. Cut briefly to Aang opening his eyes in the Avatar State and to the large Avatar State version of himself he saw while meditating. Cut back to Ozai approaching Aang who is covered by a pile of rubble.


Ozai

Come on out, little boy. You're about to be ...




Aang jumps out, now in the Avatar State, and grabs Ozai by his goatee. Ozai tries to firebend at the Avatar, but Aang merely knocks his hand away. He creates a blast of air sending Ozai flying backward. Cut briefly to an over the shoulder of Aang view of Ozai being forced away, crashing into a pillar of rock. He falls down to the ground and as the dust clears he looks up at Aang in the sky with a sphere of air around him. Aang proceeds to roar and creates fire out of his mouth, fists and feet. Aang creates a massive gust of air causing Ozai to cover himself as he groans in struggle. Pillars of earth disintegrate and move toward Aang as other pieces of rock rise up from the ground to surround Aang. Water also rises toward Aang as he creates a ring of fire around himself. The earth begins to create a ring inside the air sphere as the water continues to rise up and form another ring inside the earth sphere. Cut to Ozai who watches, covering his head with his arms. Cut back to Aang as the camera zooms out to show him surrounded by a ring of water, a ring of earth, a sphere of air and a ring of fire.
The scene changes to the liberation of Ba Sing Se as Bumi rises out of the ground with earthbending. He turns around as Fire Nation tanks appear and fire on him, but he blocks it with earthbending. He lowers the barrier smiling. He shoots rocks at the holes where they shoot fire. He subsequently uses earthbending to shoot them into the air and they land piled on top of one another while the soldiers come out the tank groaning in pain. Cut to Iroh as he burns the Fire Nation flag on Ba Sing Se Royal Palace to reveal the Earth Kingdom insignia.
The scene changes to Aang and Ozai. Aang charges at Ozai, ramming him, and blows him off his Elemental Sphere. Ozai flies away from Aang. Aang uses earthbending to shoot machine gun-like earth bullets at him. Aang chases a fleeing Ozai.
The scene changes to the Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai. A few small flames can be seen, and in the middle of them is a badly injured Zuko. He tries to get up, but he is too hurt from the lighting strike and he falls down. Katara rushes to try and help him, but Azula launches a fire blast in front of her before she can reach him. She laughs manically and shoots lightning which Katara dodges. Zuko attempts to get back up, but is too weak and can do nothing but watch as Azula shoots another lightning bolt at Katara, which she dodges. Katara turns to watch as Azula lands on a roof nearby. She begins charging another lightning attack.



Azula

I'd really rather our family physician look after Little Zuzu if you don't mind. [Azula shoots lightning and fire at her from the roof of a building. Katara manages to dodge them all and hides behind a column nearby. To Zuko in a taunting manner.] Zuzu, you don't look so good!




She shoots at Katara again. Katara manages to dodge her and moves behind another column. She spots water nearby and bends it onto the roof, but Azula has moved. Azula comes from behind her on fire jets and Katara is forced to flee. She uses the nearby water channel to make ice to slide on as Azula chases after her and fires another blast of fire which vaporizes it completely. Azula unleashes a large burst of fire, but Katara manages to get away. Katara gets off her ice path, but trips on a grate and sees some water below. She looks up and grabs some chains hanging from the wall. Cut to a wide-view of the area as Azula approaches the grates.


Azula

There you are, filthy peasant!




After a brief stare down, Katara uses multiple water whips to force Azula onto the grate. Azula is about to shoot lightning at her when Katara freezes them both with the water under the grate. Katara melts the water around her and chains Azula's hands together tied to the grate. Katara bends the water back into the grate. After catching her breath, she tightens the chains to make sure Azula cannot get free and rushes to heal Zuko. Cut to Katara as she rolls Zuko on to his back and begins healing him. Zuko opens his eyes, feeling the pain lessen, and smiles weakly at Katara, who smiles back as a she sheds a tear.


Zuko

Thank you, Katara.


Katara

I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.




She helps him up. Azula pants in anger, screams in madness, and breathes fire, writhing in an attempt to break free. Finally she stops and begins to cry uncontrollably. Katara and Zuko watch in horror and pity.
The scene changes to Avatar Aang and Phoenix King Ozai. Aang still chases Ozai and uses earthbending to move two pillars in front of Ozai, who recoils and flies away. Aang sends a wave of water at Ozai, causing him to crash to the ground. As Ozai recovers and looks up, Aang bursts through the pillar he landed near. Ozai retreats backward and shoots a stream of fire at Aang. In slow motion, Aang drops to the ground narrowly missing Ozai who propels himself away with fire from his feet. Aang rises and begins following the fleeing Ozai again. Ozai lands on a pillar and launches a wide fire blast at Aang, who uses earthbending to move two large pillars to protect himself. Aang breaks and lets the pillars fall as Ozai flies away again. Aang unleashes multiple blasts of fire toward Ozai, who manages to dodge them. Ozai lands on the side of a pillar and launchers three similar fire blasts at an approaching Aang, who uses air and water to disperse them. Aang fires a strong blast of air at Ozai, disintegrating the pillar he stood on but he manages to get away. Aang continues to chase him as Ozai looks back, realizing Aang is catching up. Aang moves his arm in a circular motion causing water to wrap itself around Ozai's leg and up to his outstretched arm, whipping him around, before slamming him on top of a pillar. Aang flies forward and earthbends Ozai's hands and feet to the ground, trapping him. Helpless, Ozai watches fearfully as Aang hovers over him, his voice echoing with the fury of his predecessors.



Aang

Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price! [Aang, under control of his past lives, combines all four elements together for his final attack. At the last second, however, he manages to regain control; he comes out of the Avatar State, lets his attack die out, and floats to the ground, freeing Ozai in the process.] No, I'm not gonna end it like this.


Ozai

Even with all the power in the world, you are still weak!




Ozai moves to attack Aang who senses it with the seismic sense he learned from Toph. He stamps down and lifts a foot up, dragging a pillar of earth along with him, deflecting Ozai's attack and binding him inside the rock. He circles Ozai and proceeds to bind his other hand as Ozai attempts to attack again. He pulls the rocks down into the earth slightly, causing Ozai to kneel. Ozai attempts one final fire breath attack, but Aang uses airbending to stop and approach him and puts one hand on Ozai's forehead, and one on his chest, while he watches in horror.
Aang closes his eyes and it flashes back to Aang's meeting with the lion turtle.



Lion turtle

In the era before the Avatar, we bent not the elements but the energy within ourselves.




The lion turtle places his paw in a similar position to Aang's hands on Ozai using its claws. The claws begin to glow green light as the camera cuts to a close-up of the lion turtle's eye before fading to Aang. Aang's head arches back and blue energy shines out of his eyes and mouth into the sky. Cut to a side-view of the event before cutting to a close-up of Ozai's terrified face as his eyes and mouth begin to shine out red energy. Aang's, followed by Ozai's, bodies become consumed by the blue and red energies. Cut to a wide-view of the area showing half blue and half red energy in the sky.


Lion turtle

[Aang remembering.] To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable or you will be corrupted and destroyed.




As he speaks, Ozai's energy begins to make its way to Aang's body, consuming the blue and replacing it with red energy. Cut to a view above Aang looking down at his face as the energy reaches his face and continues to cover the beams shining out his mouth and eyes. Cut to a side-view as the red light begins to take control and the blue light diminishes. Cut to close-up of Aang as the red energy has taken over almost completely with just one eye left. The blue energy begins to disappear, but at the last second it blasts out of Aang's eyes, overwhelming the red energy in the process and proceeding to take over Ozai's own body. Cut to a wide shot of the area as Aang completely takes over Ozai's energy and an intense beam of blue energy erupts into the sky. The beam disappears and Ozai falls to the ground as Aang releases him. Ozai attempts to rise and attack, but falls back exhausted and unable to bend.


Ozai

[Out of breath.] What? What did you do to me?


Aang

I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.




Aang steps forward and looks toward the sea as fire spreads on the land below. Aang breathes deeply and enters the Avatar State briefly, showing his control of the ability. Aang begins to bend the water from the ocean below to extinguish the fires. Cut to many shots of the water rising to extinguish the fires. Cut back to Aang as he lowers the water back to its normal level. Cut to a side-view of Aang as the camera zooms out as Momo returns to Aang's shoulder. Cut to the comet flying away as Sokka, Toph, and Suki are seen leaving the airship they were on. Sokka is being carried by the other two due to his broken leg.


Sokka

You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like [Pretends to be Aang fighting Ozai while adding sound effects.] and the Fire Lord was all like [Pretends to be Ozai struggling and groaning.]


Suki

[Pointing to the exhausted Ozai while approaching him.] So did you, you know ... finish the job?


Ozai

[Defiantly and slowly.] I'm still alive. [Suki backs away from him.]


Aang

I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.


Toph

[Surprised.] Wow! Who taught you that?


Aang

A giant lion turtle.


Toph

[Smiling.] You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.


Sokka

Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord.


Ozai

[Weakly.] I am the Phoenix King! [Flops on the ground while semi-conscious and drooling.]


Toph

[Mockingly.] Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Phoenix King of Getting His Butt Whooped.


Suki

[Patheically.] Yeah! Or how about King of the ... Guys Who ... Don't Win?


Toph

[Pointing at Suki before pointing to herself; gently.] Leave the nicknames to us, honey.




Cut to a shot of the comet leaving, returning the sky to the darkness of night time. Cuts to inside the Fire Nation Royal Palace. Zuko is having trouble putting on his robe due to his injury.


Mai

You need some help with that?


Zuko

Mai! You're okay! They let you out of prison?


Mai

My uncle pulled some strings. And it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend.


Zuko

So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?


Mai

[Blushes.] I think it means I actually kind of like you. [They kiss. When they break apart, Mai's tone and expression changes to a serious and stern one.] But don't ever break up with me again! [Zuko grins nervously, before they hug again.]




In the Fire Nation Coronation Plaza, people from all over the world have congregated for the coronation of the new Fire Lord, among which several familiar faces: The Duke hugs Toph, and she reciprocates as Pipsqueak and members of the Foggy Swamp Tribe watch. Sokka and Katara look for and find Chief Hakoda.


Katara and Sokka

Dad! [They run to Hakoda and embrace him.]


Hakoda

I heard what you two did. I am the proudest father in the world. [Turns to Katara.] And your mother would be proud, too. [Katara sheds a few tears of joy while touching her necklace.]




The Kyoshi Warriors approach.


Sokka

There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?


Ty Lee

[Appearing from behind.] It feels great!


Sokka

[Protects Suki and points his crutch at Ty Lee.] Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.



Suki


It's okay. She's one of us now. [Sokka turns to Ty Lee before turning back to Suki, with a stunned look for both.]


Ty Lee

Yeah, the girls and I really bonded in prison. And after a few chi blocking lessons, they said I could join their group. We're going to be best friends forever. [She hugs two other warriors and they all smile.]




Cut to inside the Royal Palace, where Aang, now wearing the robes and necklace of an airbending master, opens his eyes from his meditation as Zuko approaches.


Zuko

I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down. And now ...


Aang

And now we're friends.


Zuko

Yeah, we are friends.


Aang

I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The world's so different now.


Zuko

[Puts a hand on Aang's shoulder.] And it's gonna be even more different. We'll rebuild it together. [They hug warmly and go outside.]




Cut to outside the palace with people from the Fire Nation, the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom and the Foggy Swamp Tribe all outside. Cut to a side-view as Zuko walks past while a gong is struck. Cut to a overhead view of the crowd with Zuko approaching. The crowd cheers. Front view of Zuko as he raises his hand.


Zuko

Please. The real hero is the Avatar. [Aang walks next to Zuko. Crowd cheers again. Aang turns his head slightly. Cut to side-view of Katara. The camera rotates as she smiles up at Aang proudly. Cut to overhead view of Aang and Zuko, their backs to the camera, looking out at the crowd.] Today this war is finally over! [Cut briefly to Haru, Tyro, Mechanist and Teo as the crowd cheers. Cut to front view of Zuko.] I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will. [Panning front view of Zuko and Aang, as seen from the crowd's perspective.] The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. [Cut to side shot of Aang, rotating around, as he turns to see Zuko smile at him, before turning back to the crowd.] But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace.




Zuko kneels down, preparing to be crowned Fire Lord. Cut to a Fire Sage approaching with the headpiece.


Fire Sage

[Puts the Fire Lord headpiece into Zuko's top knot.] All hail Fire Lord Zuko! [Everyone cheers again. Zuko rises.]




Cut to Zuko walking toward the cheering crowd, gesturing Aang to follow him. Aang approaches and they look briefly at each other before looking out at the crowd. Cut to Zuko walking to the Fire Nation Prison Tower. Cuts to inside as he enters Ozai's cell.


Ozai

[Sarcastically.] I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lowly prison cell.


Zuko

You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.


Ozai

Hmph.


Zuko

Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.


Ozai

Why are you really here?


Zuko

Because you're going to tell me something. [Bends closer to Ozai; gravely.] Where is my mother?




In Ba Sing Se, kids are now using the stacked Fire Nation tanks as a game. Cut to the Jasmine Dragon, Appa looking in from the outside. Cut inside as Zuko is serving Team Avatar tea and Iroh is playing the tsungi horn. Aang is playing with Momo. Sokka is painting a picture.


Sokka

Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.


Katara

That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. [Suddenly looks annoyed. Cuts to Sokka's painting, which is very unlike the group.] Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?


Sokka

Those are your hair loopies!


Zuko

At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine! My hair is not that spiky!


Mai

I look like a man.


Suki

And why did you paint me firebending?


Sokka

I thought it looked more exciting that way. [Momo jumps on to the table and chitters.] Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo? [Momo chitters again as Aang goes outside.]


Iroh

[Points at painting.] Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down.


Toph

Well I think you all look perfect! [They laugh.]




Aang walks past Appa, petting him briefly, before he moves to watch the sun set. Katara approaches from behind with a smile on her face and turns to Aang. Aang turns to look at her and he smiles back. Cut to close-up of Katara smiling and blushing. She places a hand on his shoulder and they hug. Cut to close-up view of Aang before cutting to Katara as they smile and open their eyes. They step out of the embrace and look out at the sun set as the camera pans back, but cuts back to Katara turning to face Aang. Aang turns to face her and Katara passionately kisses Aang, who returns it and they embrace each other as they kiss. Cut to a shot of them still kissing with the sun on the horizon and Ba Sing Se in the background as the camera pans up to the sky. The words "The End" fade in. Fade to credits.
