The episode opens to a cloudy sky, looking toward the ground. The point of view switches to one above the clouds as they pass by. A messenger hawk floats into view, emitting a cry. When Appa overshadows the bear and roars, it shrieks again and stoops down, swiveling out of view. The camera shifts to a side-view of Appa soaring along with Aang, Katara and Sokka in his saddle.


Katara

[Voice-over; somewhat dreamily.] Those clouds look so soft, [Cut to Aang sitting lazily atop Appa's head, a twig in his mouth; the view pans to the left, showing Sokka carving something with an uninterested look on his face, Katara lying on her stomach, popped up on her elbows, staring dreamingly over the rim of Appa's saddle, and Momo sleeping on the luggage.] don't they? Like you just jump down and land on a big, soft cottony heap?


Sokka

[Turns to Katara; mockingly with a smile.] Maybe you should give it a try.


Katara

[Looks at Sokka with annoyance; sarcastically as she looks away from him.] You're hilarious.


Aang

[Frontal shot; excitedly.] I'll try it! [Carrying his staff, he jumps off Appa with a big smile on his face. As he begins to fall, he turns once around his axis, winking at the camera as he passes. He falls down spreadeagled, laughing joyously.] Yeah!




Cut to a side-view of Appa's saddle as Katara and Sokka pop their heads over the rim, looking down in the direction Aang went. Cut to an upward looking shot following Aang falling down, still smiling broadly. As he passes the camera, it tilts down, following him as he vanishes in a cloud. Cut back to the siblings; Katara looks somewhat worried, while Sokka gazes wide-eyed at the point where Aang vanished. When he leans over to search the sky, Aang comes back up from behind them on his glider. The siblings turn around as they hear the snapping noise of Aang's glider being closed, and they watch how the airbender plops down on the saddle, his legs spread apart and a big smile on his face. Cut to a side-view of an unimpressed looking Sokka, before switching back to a frontal shot of Aang who is dripping wet.


Aang

[Looking at himself.] Turns out, clouds are made of water.




He breaths in deeply and slams his balled, right fist against his stretched left hand, creating an expanding air ball around him in the process, drying himself off. As Aang leans back to rest on both his hands, he contently looks at Momo, whose fur got all fluffed by Aang's airbending. Cut to a side-view of Sokka, who is still looking at Aang unimpressed. Katara glances at her brother, but her attention is drawn to something over his shoulder.


Katara

Hey, what is that?




Sokka looks over his right shoulder in the direction Katara is looking as well. Katara gets up and walks to the front of Appa's saddle. Cut to a shot of the landscape in front of them, a large, dark patch of burned land standing out among the lush green of the forest. Cut to a frontal view of the trio now all looking over the front rim of Appa's saddle, surprised looks on their faces.


Sokka

[Camera zooms in.] It's like a scar ...




The scene fades to a ground view of the scorched forest. The camera pans to the right, showing many burned trees, and Team Avatar standing in the middle of a gray, barren patch.


Sokka

[Voice-over.] Listen. [Cut to a frontal shot of a sad-looking Aang, his friends behind him.] It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.


Katara

Aang? Are you okay?


Sokka

[Noticing footprints; angrily.] Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for -


Katara

Shhh!


Sokka

[Whispering angrily.] What? I'm not allowed to be angry?




Katara points to Aang with a somewhat concerned look on her face as he slumps over, downcast at the sight.


Aang

[Kneels down and sighs. He picks up some ash as it slowly seeps through his hand and drops to the ground; sadly.] Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?


Katara

Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.


Aang

[Sadly.] Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job.


Katara

That's why we're going to the North Pole. [Smiling softly.] To find you a teacher.


Aang

Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.


Sokka

The Avatar before you? He died over one hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him?


Aang

I don't know. [Momo comes up to Aang and settles in his lap.]




In another area, Zuko comes looking for Iroh.


Zuko

Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!


Iroh

[Relaxing in a hot spring.] Over here!


Zuko

Uncle? We need to move on. We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him.


Iroh

You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?


Zuko

My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!


Iroh

You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself. [He breathes steam through his nose.]


Zuko

Enough! We need to leave now. Get out of the water!


Iroh

Very well! [He gets up, exposing himself.]


Zuko

[Shielding his eyes.] On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes? But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!




Iroh sighs as he slumps back into the water.
The scene returns to the forest.



Katara

[Approaches Aang.] Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up?


Aang

[Sadly.] No. [An acorn is thrown at him.] Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up?


Sokka

[Chuckles.] Cheered me up. [An acorn gets thrown at him.] Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that.


Katara

These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back. [She places the acorn in his hand and closes it.]


Aang

Thanks, Katara.




Katara smiles at him before gasping at the sight of an old man approaching.


Sokka

Hey, who are you?


Old wanderer

When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible! [Approaches Aang.] But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child? [Aang look to Katara, who nods. He nods himself.] My village desperately needs your help!




The scene cuts to them at Senlin Village at sunset. The village has been partially destroyed. The wanderer leads them into the center building.


Old wanderer

This young person is the Avatar!


Senlin Village leader

So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.


Aang

Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with?


Senlin Village leader

I'm not sure ...


Old wanderer

Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope! [To Aang.] For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit.


Sokka

Why is it attacking you?


Senlin Village leader

We do not know, but each of the last three nights, he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near.


Katara

What happens then?


Old wanderer

As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the Spirit World grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely.


Senlin Village leader

Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen.


Aang

So, what do you want me to do, exactly?


Old wanderer

Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.


Aang

Right ... that's me.


Katara

Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? [She leads him toward a window.] Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this.


Aang

Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!


Katara

So ... can you help these people?


Aang

I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me. [Momo lands on his shoulder.]


Katara

[With a kind and reassuring smile.] I think you can do it, Aang.


Sokka

[With a similar expression.] Yeah. [Brief pause.] We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.




Cut back to the hot spring. A sleeping Iroh is awoken by nearby stirring in the trees.


Iroh

Who's there? [He sees a rat-like animal.] A meadow vole! I should have known. [He takes the creature into the palm of his hand.] You startled me, little one. [Sighs.] It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.




The meadow vole leaps up and down. This is followed by shaking and the ground moving toward Iroh. Suddenly, the rock at the bottom of the spring jumps up, capturing him. Three Earth Kingdom soldiers surround him.


Soldier

[Picks up Iroh's clothes.] He's a Fire Nation soldier.


Earthbender captain

He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.




Iroh gives the captain a stern look.
Cut back to Senlin, near sunset. Aang steps outside the center building and awaits the Hei Bai.



Aang

[Walking toward the village entrance.] Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff.




Cut to the building interior. Sokka and Katara watch.


Sokka

This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.


Old wanderer

If anyone can save us, he can.


Sokka

He still shouldn't have to face this alone.




The sun sets and night falls. Cut back to Aang.


Aang

The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. [He spins his staff and sticks it down, in apparent authority.] Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then.




He walks away. Behind him, however, the Hei Bai fades into the real world. He walks right behind Aang, who turns to see him.


Aang

You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is–




The spirit releases a burst of energy at him. It moves past him.


Aang

My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! [Hei Bai wreaks havoc, smashing buildings and destroying a tower with energy.] Uhhh.


Senlin Village leader

The Avatar's methods are ... unusual.


Sokka

It doesn't seem to interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him.


Old wanderer

No. Only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei Bai.


Katara

Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.




Hei Bai smashes another building.


Aang

Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would please turn around? I command you to turn around now!




The spirit hits Aang and sends him flying to the roof of another building.


Sokka

That's it. He needs help. [Exits the building.]


Katara

Sokka, wait! [Starts to follow him.]


Senlin Village leader

[Stops her.] It's not safe!


Sokka

Hei Bai, over here! [He throws his boomerang at him, but it barely affects the monster. He runs toward it.]


Aang

Sokka, go back!


Sokka

We'll fight him together, Aang.


Aang

I don't want to fight him unless I– [Sokka is taken by the Hei Bai, and the spirit flees. Aang chases it.]


Katara

[Running to the village entrance.] Sokka! [The villagers go the entrance as well. Katara is left standing fearful.]




Back near the hot spring. Two soldiers and Zuko look for Iroh.


Zuko

Uncle! Uncle, where are you?


Fire Nation Soldier

Sir, maybe he thought you left without him.


Zuko

Something's not right here. That pile of rocks.


Fire Nation Soldier

It looks like there's been a landslide, sir.


Zuko

Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. [Stands up straight.] My Uncle's been captured by earthbenders!




Back to the forest. Aang continues to pursue the Hei Bai, looking for Sokka.


Sokka

Aang! Over here! Help!


Aang

Hang on, Sokka!




Aang pulls out his hand, trying to free Sokka. However, before he can grab him, the spirit fades away, taking Sokka with it. Aang falls in front of a bear-like statue, knocked out.
A couple of hours later, Aang awakens.



Aang

Sokka! [He realizes Sokka is nowhere to be seen.] I failed.




The next scene cuts back to the soldiers who captured Iroh. They are riding ostrich horses. One soldier carries a torch with him for light.


Iroh

Where are you taking me?


Earthbender captain

We're taking you to face justice.


Iroh

Right, but where, specifically?


Earthbender captain

A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.


Iroh

Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.


Earthbender captain

It was greater than you were, apparently.


Iroh

I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. [Yawns.] And I'm still tired. [He falls off one of the horses. He is quickly picked back up. However, he leaves one of his sandals behind and smiles cleverly.]




Cut back to Senlin Village. Katara awaits at the village entrance for Sokka and Aang. The Old wanderer approaches her.


Old wanderer

I'm sure they'll be back.


Katara

I know.


Old wanderer

[Places a blanket around her.] You should get some rest.


Katara

Everything's going to be okay ...


Old wanderer

Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him. [As he is speaking, Aang approaches.]


Aang

Katara? Katara, I lost him.




The sun rises.


Old wanderer

The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.


Aang

[His appearance is blue.] What? No, I'm right here! [He waves his hand in the Wanderer's face, only to notice his own appearance.] I'm in the Spirit World!




Cut back to the forest. Zuko comes up on Iroh's sandal.


Zuko

[Sniffs and gets a disgusted look.] Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh. [He re-mounts his rhino.]




Back at the Village.


Aang

I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. [Appa approaches.] Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! [He breathes on Katara.] But, I guess you can't see me either.


Katara

It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat. [The two return the village.]


Aang

What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? [He hears something.] Sokka? [He notices a dragon coming toward him.] That's definitely not Sokka. [He tries to fly away but cannot. He notices his airbending is not working at all.] What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. [The dragon lands just before him.] You don't know where Sokka is, do you? [The dragon touches him. He sees a vision of Roku flying on this dragon.] You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? [The dragon curls around him, and he gets on him.] I'll be back, Katara. [It gets up.] Take me to Roku! [The dragon flies away.]




Cut to a mountain the earthbenders are leading Iroh through. Iroh looks at the skies and notices the dragon and Aang. He gasps in wonder.


Earthbender captain

What's the problem?


Iroh

Nothing. [Pauses.] Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.


Earthbender captain

Too loose?


Iroh

That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.


Earthbender captain

Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs.




They all stop. The corporal dismounts and moves to Iroh. As he touches his handcuffs, Iroh breathes deeply and heats them up. He pushes the corporal's hand to the cuffs, causing him to scream in pain. Iroh jumps free and blasts fire at the soldiers. He rolls down the hill as the soldiers try to get control of their ostrich horses.
Cut back to Aang and Fang. Fang takes him to a temple on an unknown island. He flies into the temple and toward the roof.



Aang

Hey, what are you doing? [He screams, but they fly right through the roof and into a mysterious room. Within is a celestial calendar and a statue of Roku.] I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. [Fang presses one of his feelers to Aang's forehead. A vision of a comet appears to him.] Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? [Fang moves his head, allowing a light beam to appear. This is just to the right of Roku's statue. With another feeler press, he sees a vision of the sun setting and rising repeatedly, and the light closing in on Roku.] It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? [The dragon breathes an apparent yes.] But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now! [The dragon takes Aang from the temple.]




Cut back to Iroh rolling down the hill. One of the soldiers hits him with a rockslide. All of the soldiers chase after him, reaching him at the bottom of the hill.


Soldier

He's too dangerous, Captain! We just can't just carry him to the Capital! We have to do something now!


Earthbender captain

I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.




Iroh spits a rock out.
Meanwhile, Katara is flying on Appa over the forest.



Katara

It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait. [She re-directs Appa to the village's direction.]




While following the ostrich horse footprints, Zuko notices Appa.


Zuko

The Avatar! [He turns slightly, but looks back at the footprints.]




Fang takes Aang back to the statue at fast speed. Aang notices his body is there and also prepares for impact. Suddenly, Fang disappears into the statue and Aang is returned to his body. He looks around at the statue, opens his glider, and flies back to the village.
Cut to the village, sunset. Katara stands outside the center building and notices Aang's return. Aang lands and Katara runs to him.



Katara

You're back! [She embraces Aang.] Where's Sokka?


Aang

I'm not sure ...




The evening gives way to night. 
Back to Iroh, who is surrounded by the soldiers.



Earthbender captain

These dangerous hands must be crushed. [He brings up and prepares to drop it. However, Zuko jumps in and kicks the rock away before breaking Iroh's chain with his boot.]


Iroh

Excellent form, Prince Zuko.


Zuko

You taught me well.


Earthbender captain

Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.


Iroh

Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.




The solders fire rocks, but Iroh destroys them with the chains. Zuko takes out two soldiers with fire. A rock is fired at him, but Iroh catches it and throws it back at the soldiers, knocking them down. The Captain fires three rocks at Zuko, which he dodges. Zuko counters with fire blasts that are dodged. The captain brings up a large mass of rock, however, Iroh throws his chains around his ankles, knocking him and causing the rocks to fall on top of him. The soldiers are heard groaning underneath the rocks.


Zuko

Now would you please put on some clothes?




Cut back to Senlin. Aang awaits at the entrance for the Hei Bai. After some time, he gives up and returns to the center building. Just as he exits, however, the spirit appears to his left. He throws up an air shield to stop its attack.


Katara

Aang, what are you doing?! Run!




The spirit prepares to resume its attack when Aang jumps in front of it. He feels its forehead and notices that a panda lurks below it.


Aang

You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back. [He shows it the acorn and leaves it at his feet. The spirit picks it up and reverts to the panda form. It walks away peacefully. As it exits, a series of branches grow, and three villagers and Sokka emerge from it.]


Katara

Sokka! [She runs to him and embraces him, while other villagers embrace their loved ones.]


Sokka

What happened?


Katara

You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling?


Sokka

Like I seriously need to use the bathroom. [Katara gives Sokka a somewhat disgusted look.]


Senlin Village leader

Thank you, Avatar. If only there were a way to repay you for what you've done.


Sokka

You could give us some supplies, and some money.


Katara

Sokka!


Sokka

What? We need stuff.


Senlin Village leader

It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.


Katara

I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own.


Aang

Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else.


Sokka

What is it?


Aang

I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.


Katara

That's great!


Sokka

Creepy, but great.


Aang

There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.


Katara

But the solstice is tomorrow!


Aang

Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.




The siblings grow fearful. The shot slowly moves up to the moon over the hills.




Fade to credits.



The scene opens to a full moon in the sky. The camera pans down and shows Senlin Village during early morning hours. Cut to a view from among the houses, slowly zooming in on Aang who tries to get Appa to move, yanking on the reins, though the bison continually refuses and sits down.


Aang

[Strained voice.] Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! [Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang sadly addresses his pet.] Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. [Frontal shot; looks down and away, sadly.] If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. [Cut back to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening himself.] So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!




He jerks at the reins, stretching them out, but is flung to the ground when the ropes pull him back as Appa did not move a muscle. Cut to a forlorn looking Aang, sitting spread-legged on the ground.


Sokka

[Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.] I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.




Cut to a frontal shot of Appa as the camera swiftly pans to the right to reveal a collection of Senlin villagers, with Katara and Sokka standing in the front.


Katara

[Desperately.] Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. [Closer shot of Katara's pleading face.] Neither can I.


Aang

[Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.] But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! [Side-shot as he approaches his friends.] I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!




Aang airbends himself atop Appa's head. Close shot of him looking back with a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave. As Appa stands up, the shot changes to a frontal view, and Katara and Sokka run to stand before the bison, preventing him from moving any further.


Katara

We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.


Sokka

[Aang stares curiously.] At least, not without your friends. We got your back. [Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison.] Ew!


Senlin Village leader

It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. [Hands Aang a small bundle.] You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown. Good luck.


Aang

Thank you for your-


Senlin Village leader

[Interrupts sharply, yelling. Points toward the ocean.] Go!




Appa takes off with Aang, Momo, Katara, and Sokka. Later that morning, the Senlin Village leader exits a building, but he stops in his track upon finding Zuko standing in his path. In the background, Iroh is sitting on a komodo rhino.


Zuko

[The Senlin Village leader gasps.] Having trouble sleeping? [Pushes the man back through the door, knocking him down. Frontal shot as he approaches him.] Seen the Avatar lately?




Day has come. Appa soars over the ocean. Aang, Katara, and Sokka all watch the ocean fearfully.


Aang

Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster!


Iroh

[Close-up.] Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!


Zuko

I have no choice, Uncle.


Iroh

[Angrily.] Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? [Fearfully.] What if you're caught?


Zuko

[Breaks away from telescope to talk to his uncle.] I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home!


Iroh

You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!


Zuko

[Looks back into his telescope. Dark scope view reveals Appa mid-flight.] There they are. Helmsman! Full steam ahead!


Katara

[Looking back to Zuko's ship.] Aang. We've got trouble!


Sokka

[Panicked.] Yeah! And it's gaining, fast!




A Fire Nation catapult is raised to the deck of Zuko's ship. It is loaded with a steaming projectile.


Iroh

[Waving a fan at his face.] Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?


Zuko

[Lights the stinking ball with a fire punch.] On my mark! Fire!




A guard beside him slices the rope holding back the catapult. The flaming projectile races toward Appa.


Katara

[Yelling.] Fireball!


Aang

I'm on it!


Katara

[Aang, Katara, and Sokka all make faces and grasp their noses.] We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!


Sokka

Can't you make Appa go any faster?


Aang

Yeah. But there's just one little problem.


Zuko

[Close-up. Eyes widening.] A blockade.




Birds-eye view of a two-row line of Fire Nation ships stretching across the ocean as far as the eye can see. Brief glimpse of numerous Fire Nation catapults prepared to fire.


Iroh

Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.


Aang

If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the only way.


Katara

There's no time!


Aang

This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous!


Katara

And that's exactly why we're here.


Sokka

[Boldly.] Let's run this blockade! [Both Katara and Sokka grin confidently.]


Aang

Appa, yip-yip! [Appa roars readily, sailing forward even quicker.]


Zuko

He's not turning around!


Iroh

Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.


Zuko

[Lowers his head, closes his eyes, and clenches his hands into fists. Sorrowfully.] I'm sorry, Uncle. [Raises his head, opens his eyes, and thrusts his right hand forward commandingly.] Run the blockade!


Zhao

[Gazing through telescope.] The Avatar. [Lowers telescope lens to spot Zuko's ship.] And the banished prince. [Lowers telescope.] This must be my lucky day.


Captain

Commander Zhao. What are your orders?


Zhao

Shoot the bison down, captain.


Captain

[Surprised.] But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, sir! One of our own! What if it's hit?


Zhao

So be it. [Captain backs up in shock. Zhao continues coolly.] It belongs to a traitor. [Command.] Ignite. Launch!




The sky becomes littered with flaming fireballs fired from the blockade. View from Zuko's ship as the fireballs fill the sky. Close-up of a screaming Aang, Sokka, and Katara. Zoom out as Appa evades numerous fireballs, some exploding mid-air. Camera switch to forward view, close-up, as they fly through a blanket of fireballs. The team flies directly through one that exploded before them, Appa's fur darkened from the explosion. Katara, Sokka, and Momo all slap out embers on Appa's fur.


Aang

Appa, are you okay? [Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the clouds.]




On the ocean surface, Zuko's ship is narrowly missing many falling fireballs. Sheets of ocean water crash over the ship, and crew members run for safety. A single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel.


Engineer

Prince Zuko! The engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!


Zuko

[Spins away from the man, facing the blockade.] Do not stop this ship.


Zhao

Launch!




Close-up of Aang's view. Just over a cloud; fireballs burst through everywhere and smoke fills the screen. Aang, Katara, and Sokka scream and duck away, while Katara and Sokka grip Appa's saddle. Appa dodges many fireballs before two collide and explode in front of him. Sokka is thrown from the saddle and begins to plunge for the ocean, screaming anew.


Aang

[Cries out desperately.] Sokka! [Whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of Sokka.]




Appa reaches Sokka just in time. Katara grabs his hand, pulling him back into saddle. Appa skims the ocean surface. A fish appears out of nowhere and slaps Sokka square in the face, knocking him into the saddle. Momo leaps up and grabs the fish as Appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean. Fireballs crash into the water all around them.


Zhao

Ready ... [Holds hand up, issuing his command.]




Close-up of Appa's view, approaching the ships. Camera switch once to Zhao, moving to prepare the signal. Back to Aang, a look of obstinate determination overcomes him.


Zhao

Fire!




A single catapult launches a fire blast directly toward Appa. Close-up of Aang's eye as it snaps open, unafraid. Aang airbends forward off of Appa's head. He uses a powerful airbending kick, and the flaming boulder explodes in a large smoky blast. Aang falls back to Appa's head, Katara and Sokka grabbing him. Appa soars safely over the blockade, passing them.


Aang

[Ecstatic.] We made it!


Sokka

[Katara and Sokka each grimacing in terror.] We got into the Fire Nation. [Meekly.] Great.


Captain

Where do you think the Avatar is headed, sir?


Zhao

I'm not sure. [Turns aside, gazes at Zuko's smoking ship.] But I bet a certain banished prince will know.




Scene switch to just overhead Zuko's ship. His small vessel approaches two ships in the blockade. These two ships sail opposite directions, in a moment they will close off Zuko's ship's path.


Iroh

We're on a collision course!


Zuko

[Confidently.] We can make it!


Captain

[Captain stands ahead of a squad of nine firebenders.] The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.


Zhao

[Swiftly.] Wait! Cut the engines, and let them pass.


Captain

Sir?




Each ship in the blockade halts, allowing Zuko's ship to glide by beneath their deck, untouched. Zhao stands high, sharing an interlocked gaze with the banished prince below. Zuko and Iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely through. Iroh strokes his gray beard curiously.




The scene cuts back to Appa, flying among blue skies. Sokka and Katara sit up in the saddle, while Aang sits on Appa's head.
The scene changes to Sokka slumped in the back of the saddle. Katara is leaning her arms over the front of the saddle, and Aang is lounging against Appa's neck.
The sky has changed to a darker, sunset-filled evening. Appa is visibly tired. Aang is sprawled over Appa's head with Momo equally sprawled over Aang's head. Katara and Sokka have each collapsed into the saddle.



Aang

[Close-up. Momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise.] There it is! [Sokka and Katara pop up in the saddle.] The island where Roku's dragon took me. [Full view of Crescent Island and its smoking volcano as Appa descends.]




Appa is lying at the base of a stone bridge leading up to the island's mountain. The bridge ends at an elegant, multi-story Fire Temple. Lava is flowing beneath the bridge. The air is thick with steam. Aang stands by Appa's head, and Katara stands to Appa's side. Sokka is stretching further away.


Aang

[Rubs against Appa's head.] You did it buddy. Nice flying. [Appa bellows in satisfaction, rolling to his side to wave his three legs into the air lazily. Appa's tongue lolls out.]


Katara

[Smiles sweetly and approaches Appa. Rubs his belly.] Aww, you must be tired.


Sokka

[Joyous. Katara's expresses dumbfounded interest.] No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders! [Continues to work out and flex his body.]


Katara

[Props hand off hip. Responds dryly.] I was talking to Appa.


Sokka

[Instantly halts exercise.] Well ... I was talking to Momo. [Points to the lemur clinging to a dead tree's branch.]




Scene cut to Katara, Sokka, Aang, and Momo walking along the stone bridge to approach a multi-story Fire Temple.


Sokka

[Close-up, top-to-bottom view of the Fire Temple.] I don't see any guards.


Katara

[Camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps.] The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.


Aang

It's almost sundown. We better hurry! [The group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door.]


Sokka

[The group tip-toes through an enormous chamber with fire-decor columns.] Wait. I think I heard something.


Great Fire Sage

[Turning around, they see five men standing in the hallway dressed in red with tall hats.] We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.


Aang

Great! I am the Avatar!


Great Fire Sage

We know. [Inhales briskly before punching a blast of fire their direction.]


Aang

[Deflects three balls of fire with his airbending. Close-up. Shouts over his shoulder.] I'll hold them off. Run!




Aang leaps forward and spins his leg across the ground, sending a low air blade that sweeps the Fire Sages' legs out from beneath them, and they all fall to the ground. Aang flees after his friends.


Great Fire Sage

If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him.


Aang

[Hallway view; Aang skids in front of Katara and Sokka and continues running.] Follow me!


Sokka

Do you know where you're going? [The two follow Aang.]


Aang

[Rounds a corner and disappears from sight.] Nope! [A moment passes, Katara and Sokka stop when Aang skids into view again. Fearfully.] Wrong way! [Runs past them.]


Shyu

[Rounds the corner, frightening Sokka and Katara to chase after Aang.] Come back!




The trio turns another corner and charges down the hallway. However, they reach a dead-end as Aang skids to an immediate halt. Turning around, they face Shyu, who raises a hand in peace.


Shyu

I don't want to fight you! I am a friend.


Sokka

Firebenders aren't our friends! [Aang steps ahead of his friends, assuming an airbending posture.]


Shyu

[Steps toward the Avatar, before dropping to his knees and pressing his palms to the floor in submission. This startles Aang, Katara, and Sokka.] I know why you're here, Avatar.


Aang

[Surprised.] You do?


Shyu

Yes. [Rises from the floor to stand again.] You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.


Aang

[Skeptically.] How?


Shyu

[Slides back a lamplight on the wall. Places palm on wall, focuses firebending into this location to open a secret passage.] This way.


Great Fire Sage

[Echoes in the distance.] Find him.


Shyu

[Briefly glances down the hall.] Time is running out! Quickly!




Aang and Katara exchange a look with one another, asserting each other's belief to trust this firebender. The group enters the passage and descends the steps into the cave. Shyu enters behind them and closes the passageway.


Zuko

[Close-up. Tightens knuckles on ship's railing. Smoke billows behind his ship.] What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?


Iroh

Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.


Zuko

[Close-up.] If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.


Shyu

[Brief scene cut to show the sun nearly setting. Far overhead view of Shyu leading the group through caverns.] Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.


Aang

Did you know Avatar Roku?


Shyu

No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this Fire Temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.


Aang

Is that how you knew I was coming?


Shyu

A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku; its eyes began to glow!


Katara

That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!


Shyu

At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.


Aang

If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?


Shyu

Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.


Aang

[Looking down, guiltily.] They were waiting for me.


Sokka

[Humorously mocking.] Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! [Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.]


Shyu

They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. [Shakes head sadly.] I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages.


Aang

Thank you for helping me. [Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.]


Shyu

[Continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs.] We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary. [Time skip, Shyu continues talking as they near the top of the stairs.] Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.




Slides back a secret tile and climbs into the outer sanctuary. Massive columns with dragon statues atop them line the room. An immense door is before them with a device holding five open-mouthed dragons.


Shyu

[Gasps.] No!


Aang

[Approaches door.] Shyu, what's wrong?


Shyu

The sanctuary doors, they're closed!


Katara

[Aang tugs at the door uselessly.] Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?


Shyu

No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, [Sokka shown in deep thought.] with five simultaneous fire blasts.


Sokka

[Ponderously states.] Five fire blasts, huh? [Zoom out to show a lamplight above him.] I think I can help you out.




The scene switches to Zuko's smoke-billowing ship. Close-up to show a small vessel holding Zuko being slid into the waters.


Zuko

Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.




Iroh grunts in doubt, stroking his beard in deep thought. Zuko's boat settles on the ocean's surface and disappears in the smoke. Switch to a telescope view of nothing but smoke. Zhao lowers telescope, staring with determination.
Switch to view of sanctuary door.



Sokka

[Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag.] This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, [Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him.] ta-da! Fake firebending!


Katara

[Impressed.] You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.


Shyu

This might actually work.


Shyu

[Time skip. Sokka places his last bag into the dragon's mouth.] The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!


Katara

[Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides.] It's almost sunset. Are you ready?


Aang

Definitely.




Shyu thrusts his finger forward, sending a small flare racing across the door to light all five bags at once. Shyu hurries to take cover. There is an intense explosion, producing a lot of smoke. Aang bursts forward and runs for the door. Aang strains to open the door, which has not budged.


Aang

[Surprised.] They're still locked!


Shyu

[Sadly sighs. Sokka rises from hiding behind his sister.] It didn't work. [Aang falls to his knees.]


Aang

[Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.] Why, won't, it, open?!


Katara

[Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm.] Aang! Stop! [Relaxes, releasing his arm.] There's nothing else we can do ...


Aang

[Glumly.] I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.


Sokka

[Examining the explosion. Runs his finger across the black soot.] I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.


Katara

[A moment passes. Sudden excitement.] Sokka, you're a genius!


Aang

[Confused.] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.


Sokka

[Pleasantly.] Come on Aang. Let her dream.


Katara

You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did.


Aang

[Dubiously.] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.]


Shyu

[Time skip. Fire Sages run toward Shyu in front of the door.] Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!


Great Fire Sage

How did he get in?


Shyu

I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! [Points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door.]


Great Fire Sage

He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!




Aang slides into position behind a nearby column as the five sages firebend the doors locks open. As the door opens, a sooty Momo is revealed sitting on the floor. Momo sneezes, blowing the soot off himself.


Great Fire Sage

It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!




Momo springs into action, leaping atop the Great Fire Sage's head and clinging to his hat. Katara charged forward, pulling a nearby sage's tunic over his head to blind him. Sokka grabs the lower skirt of a sage's outfit, lifting it completely over his body to cover his face.


Shyu

[Grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip, pinning him.] Now, Aang!


Katara

[A moment of silence.] Aang! Now's your chance!


Zuko

[Steps out from behind column. Grips Aang from behind, pinning Aang's arms behind him.] The Avatar's coming with me! [The captured sages use their captors' surprise to reclaim the upper hand, pinning their captors down. Momo flies off with the Great Fire Sage's hat.] Close the doors! Quickly!




Walking down steps, Aang glances over his shoulders to see Sokka and Katara being chained to a column. He breaks free, spinning behind Zuko to send him down the stairs with an airbending blast. Aang runs for Katara and Sokka.


Katara

[Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door.] Go!




Aang listens without hesitation, turning to charge for the door guarded by two sages. He leaps into the air to avoid the Great Fire Sage's fire punch. Aang bounces off his hands from each of the two sage's heads before sailing through the door just as it closes.


Katara

[Pleased.] He made it!




Everyone looks away as the door seals with a blinding flash of white light. Inside, Aang is kneeling and looks up to a tall statue of Avatar Roku. A beam of red sunlight enters the room and strikes a glistening red jewel held by the statue.


Aang

[Stands. Confused.] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?


Zuko

[He and four sages launch fire blasts into the door's locks. Nothing happens. Frustrated.] Why isn't it working, it's sealed shut?


Great Fire Sage

It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.


Aang

[Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!




Roku's statue turns red as sunlight engulfs it. Its eyes glow white. View of Aang as smoke fills the room. When the white smoke dissipates Avatar Roku is standing before him, they are on a mountaintop and only clouds are visible below.


Roku

It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long? [Aang respectfully places a fist into his palm, bowing his head to the Avatar before him.]


Zuko

[Firmly to Shyu, who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back.] Why did you help the Avatar?


Shyu

[Sadly and proudly.] Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty.


Zhao

[Claps. Interrupts interrogation. Approaches with six firebender guards.] What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him.


Great Fire Sage

[Places palms together. Bows head forward.] Commander Zhao.


Zhao

And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. [Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his arms.] Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.


Zuko

[Strains against his captor, snaps at Zhao.] You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.


Zhao

No matter. [Grins confidently.] Sooner or later, he has to come out. [Katara and Sokka share a worried glance.]


Roku

I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you.


Aang

[Interested, curious.] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?


Roku

Yes.


Aang

What does it mean?


Roku

One hundred years ago, [Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky.] Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.


Aang

[Close-up.] So the comet made them stronger?


Roku

[Close-up.] Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.


Aang

[Close-up.] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now?


Roku

Listen carefully. [Viewers see silhouette of Fire Lord Ozai standing amid flames, fists taut.] Sozin's Comet will return by the end of the summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. [Visual and audio of Ozai's silhouette roaring upward, fire streaming from his mouth.] If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You must defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives.


Aang

[Counters anxiously.] But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!


Roku

Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end. [Close-up of a shocked Aang.]




Firebenders, including Zhao and his crew, circle around the door's perimeter, assuming a firebending form. A monk chant begins for the audience only. They wait patiently for the door to open.


Zhao

When those doors open, [Shouts.] unleash all your firepower!


Katara

[Worried.] How's Aang gonna make it out of this?


Sokka

[Troubled, questioning.] How are we gonna make it out of this?


Aang

[Terrified.] What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?


Roku

I know you can do it Aang. [Close-up of half his face.] For you have done it before. [Close-up of half of Aang's now-smiling face.] The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now.


Aang

But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?


Roku

I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. [Closes his eyes, providing Aang a vision of Fire Navy ships surrounding the island. Speaks to his mind without words.] A great danger awaits you at the temple. [Provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door.] I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.


Aang

[Eyes and arrows glow.] I'm ready.




Scene switches to the guard surrounding the door. The door glows bright white once again. Smoke streams come through into the room. The door unlocks itself, beginning to open. As it opens, a blinding white light forces all present to look away.


Zhao

Ready ... [Light fades, revealing a pair of glowing white eyes in the darkness.]


Katara

[Sokka struggles against his chains. Katara is terrified.] No! Aang!


Zhao

Fire! [He and his guards cooperate in blasting fire onto the unseen target.]




The wall of fire amasses, circling its new host as Avatar Roku, eyes aglow, is revealed behind the flames, untouched. Close-up of a shocked and horror-stricken Zhao.


Shyu

[In awe.] Avatar Roku ...




Avatar Roku draws the circling fire together in one motion. He sends it forward in one powerful wave that sears the room, blasting the offenders off their feet and melting the chains binding Katara, Sokka, Shyu, and Zuko with precision. View of outside the temple as the blast destroys the outer wall. Close-up of ghostly Avatar Roku, turning his glowing glare upon the offending sages. The sages panic, all turning to run from his wrath.


Shyu

[Implores.] Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!


Katara

Not without Aang!




Roku kneels into a forward strike, melting the floor with a molten firebending trail. He steadily lifts his hand, causing the stream of lava below to erupt into maddened explosions. The lava soars through the temple, tearing it apart. Zhao and his firebenders are shown fleeing for the temple's exit.
Katara and Sokka huddle together, arm-in-arm, behind a column. Sokka kneels over his sister, protecting her in a brotherly fashion. The destruction ceases momentarily as Roku lowers his hands, exhaling soundly. The solstice' beam of sunlight is shown leaving his statue; its eyes no longer glow. As this happens all smoke in the room draws in upon Avatar Roku, his form disappearing to leave behind a weary Aang.



Sokka

[Aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees. Sokka and Katara approach Aang's sides, supportively lifting him back to his feet.] We got your back.


Aang

[Weakly.] Thanks. Where's Shyu?


Katara

[ Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang.] I don't know.




Visual of the temple as it begins to lean, due to the destruction caused. Aang, Katara and Sokka stare in horror upon seeing the stairwell leading to the exit filled with lava. They quickly turn to the only exit; the hole in the wall Roku had created. There is no escaping, as they are on the top level of the temple.
All three gasp in surprise as they notice Appa and Momo swiftly closing in. They run out of the temple, leaping into Appa's saddle. Scene of them flying away on Appa, gazing back at the destruction. Momo pops up wearing the Great Fire Sage's hat. Scene of Zhao watching the bison fly away.



Zhao

[Turns angrily, snapping.] No Prince, no Avatar! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five traitors!


Great Fire Sage

[Interjects.] But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar.


Zhao

[Close-up.] Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all guilty! [Orders.] Take them to the prison hold!




The scene changes to show Zuko spying with his telescope toward Appa flying away. He lowers the telescope and sails off in his vessel.
Night time falls. Appa flies through the clouds. Scene from behind, a mourning Aang with his head hung. Katara and Sokka stand and approach their friend, kneeling behind him to support him. Katara puts her hand around Aang's shoulders.





Fades to credits.
