The episode starts in the Black Cliffs, with the scene cutting to a shot of three maps lying splayed out on the ground. Cut to Sokka who ponders over the maps intensely. He closes his eyes and rubs his forehead, seemingly confused. Two gloved hands suddenly appear, one holding a cup and the other moving Sokka's hand aside from his forehead to hand him the cup. The hand comes to rest on his shoulders comfortingly. Cut to zoomed out shot of Sokka sitting by a cliff-edge, the maps laid out before him. Katara is kneeling right beside him, having been the one to hand him the cup. Toph can be seen in the background, sitting idly on a rock. Aang suddenly appears on-screen, leaping into the air and landing beside Toph.


Aang

[Momo jumps onto his shoulder; cheerfully.] Top of the morning, Momo!


Katara

[Rises and places hands on hips.] Sounds like you slept well.


Aang

[Moves his hand aside in a sweeping motion.] Like a baby moose lion. [Assumes a fighting stance and raises fists; exuberantly.] I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.


Toph

So, what's your strategy for taking him down? [Smiling and raises her hands to her eyes, her fingers wiggling outward in a mimicry of the Avatar State.] Gonna get your glow on and [Punches the air with a determined expression on her face.] hit him with a little Avatar State action?


Aang

[Looks down sorrowfully.] I can't. [Cut to side-view of him, the camera panning slightly to the left.] When Azula shot me with lightning, [Close his eyes briefly.] my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe. [Cut back to shot of him and Toph.]


Toph

You know what I just heard? [Holds up one hand and opens and closes it in a "gibber-gabber" expression.] Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space. [Bored.]


Katara

[Cut to a wide shot of the ocean; thick fog is visible on the horizon.] Oh, no. [Cut to a shot of Katara, appearing concerned.] Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?


Sokka

[Stands up.] No. [Cut to close-up of the fog, five Water Tribe ships suddenly appearing from amid the mist.] That is the invasion!




Cut to shot of Hakoda standing on the deck of one ship, peering through a telescope; Bato stands in the background. Hakoda lowers the telescope and smiles confidently. Scene fades to shot of the shoreline where Aang and Toph stand in the background by the water. They utilize earthbending to raise rock from beneath the water and form a dock. Cut to overhead shot of the Black Cliffs to show four Water Tribe ships already docked. The last Water Tribe ship is seen coming into port. Cut to closer shot of one ship by the dock, Hakoda standing nearby. Katara and Sokka run over to him.


Katara

You made it, Dad! [Cut to shot of Katara embracing her father happily.]


Sokka

[Spirited.] Where you able to locate everyone I told you to find?


Hakoda

I did. [Two members of the Foggy Swamp Tribe disembark. Doubtfully.] But I'm a little worried, Sokka. Some of these men aren't exactly the "warrior type". [Turns head slightly toward the two swamp dwellers.]




Cut to frontal shot of Tho and Due as they descend the wooden ramp from the ship.


Due

[Enthusiastically, swinging his arm.] Oooh-whee! [Cut to shot of the two men standing on the dock.] This place ain't nothing like a swamp. [Points accusingly to a rock in the water.] What you reckon that is, Tho? Some sort of Fire Nation exploding trap what eat ya?


Tho

[Impartial.] It's just a rock, Due.


Due

[Grins.] Well, I'll be. [Scratching his head.]


Hakoda

Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat?


Bato

[Walks past, behind the chief and his family, stopping beside Sokka.] I just wish they would wear pants.


Huu

[Cut to shot of Huu standing alone on the dock. Scratches his stomach.] Pants are an illusion, and so is death.




Cut to shot of the Hakoda, Katara, and Bato appearing less than reassured; Sokka, on the other hand, grins widely. Scene fades to far shot of Katara, Aang, Toph, and several Foggy Swamp members clustered by the shore, talking among themselves. A pair of legs appears on screen, boasting Earth Kingdom clothing. A voice speaks.


Haru

[Off-screen.] Hi, Katara. [Cut to close-up of the figure who reveals himself to be Haru; he smiles, now sporting a small mustache and goatee.]


Katara

[Cut to zoomed out shot of Haru.] Haru! [Runs over and embraces him.] It's so good to see you!


Aang

[Appears on screen with Toph.] Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending.


Haru

[With Katara resting a hand on his shoulder.] Katara inspired me and my father to take back our village. [Turns to Katara who blushes and looks away.]


Tyro

[Tyro appears and lays his hands on Haru's and Katara's shoulders.] You helped us find our courage, Katara. [Katara turns to him.] Now we're here to help you.




Toph suddenly senses someone on her left. She angrily turns and takes a fighting stance.


Toph

No way! Is that-




She is lifted off the ground by two big arms. The camera shows that the arms actually belong to the Big Bad Hippo, a former competitor at Earth Rumble VI. He is joined by the Boulder, another former competitor. The Hippo hugs Toph.


Big Bad Hippo

Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit!


Toph

[Angrily.] You guys here for a rematch?


The Boulder

Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our kingdom!


Toph

[Smiling.] Sweet.




The camera cuts to Sokka, while The Hippo puts Toph down. He turns to his dad. Suddenly, a bomb explodes on a boat, making Sokka, Hakoda, and Aang run toward it. The mechanist appears from below deck, coughing. Teo leaves the boat, followed immediately by his father, and Pipsqueak carrying The Duke on his shoulder.


Sokka

Was that a new invention?


Mechanist

[Teo licking his fingers clean.] Yes, but unfortunately the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce prove to be a failure.


Sokka

[The others seems disgusted.] You're making peanut sauce bombs?


Pipsqueak

They're destructive.


The Duke

And delicious. [They both lick the sauce that splashed all over their faces. Momo flies over to Pipsqueak and starts licking his face, much to his and The Duke's amusement.]


Sokka

Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?


Mechanist

Yes, I was, and I think the Fire Nation will be quite surprised.


Teo

Aang, my dad and I made this for you.




Hands a staff to Aang. Aang taps it on the ground and it opens, revealing a brand new glider.


Aang

A new glider! This is amazing!


Mechanist

And as a special feature, I added the snack compartment. [Rotates the handle, making the snacks come out.]


Aang

Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy.




The scene cuts to the Fire Nation prison where Iroh was sent to.


Warden Poon

I bet you're tired of being in this cell old man. Well too bad. [Camera shows Iroh's face.] You're never stepping outside these walls again.


Ming

[Enters.] Breakfast.


Warden Poon

[Stands.] Careful, Ming, don't get too close. His stench will knock you right out. [Leaves, laughing.]


Ming

[Looks at Poon contemptuously and approaches Iroh.] I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas.


Iroh

[Ming places the tray of tea inside Iroh's cell.] Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.




The scene cuts to show a very nervous Sokka standing on a podium with his father and Team Avatar


Hakoda

Don't worry, you'll do great.


Sokka

Good morning everyone. Ahh! [Trips on stage.] Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? [Laughs nervously.] Uh anyway, [Dropping scrolls. Unraveling one on a board.] the Fire Lord's palace is here [Points at map, realizing it isn't the map, flips the chart several times until it is the map.]. Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, [Brief shot of Due scratching his head.] and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! [Brief shot of Teo and the mechanist looking on.] And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning [Stands up straight, and begins talking very fast.]. Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, [Water Tribe warrior yawns.] who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ...


Katara

[Cut to Katara speaking over Sokka as he continues talking.] Wow, when he says the beginning he means the beginning beginning. [Hakoda gets up and approaches Sokka.]


Sokka

... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...


Hakoda

[Interrupting.] Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break? [Sokka leaves the stage to sit down, disappointed in himself. Hakoda addresses the crowd.] Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. [Shot of Haru stroking his chin. Everyone pays attention to Hakoda.] Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage. [Shot of Sokka looking down, sad, Katara, Momo and Aang looking at Hakoda and Toph.] To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, [Points at map.] The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin.


The Boulder

Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade during the eclipse, when the firebenders are powerless?


Hakoda

The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over!




The entire crowd cheers, and Sokka looks dismayed.




The scene cuts to show the team preparing for the upcoming battle. Katara is bending four streams of water into water skins, Toph is putting on her Blind Bandit battle armor, Hakoda is putting on a black Water Tribe helmet, Appa is shown fully dressed in his armor which Sokka made, and Aang is shaving his head to show his Air Nomad tattoos. He is joined by a koala sheep. The scene cuts again to the Fire Nation Palace. Zuko takes off his head piece and armor, revealing the clothes underneath it and letting his hair hang down. He sits and starts to write a letter. The camera cuts once again to show Sokka, still dismayed, standing on the cliff side and Aang flying up to him.


Aang

We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.


Sokka

I messed up Aang.


Aang

What?


Sokka

The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart.


Aang

[Approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.] Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.


Sokka

My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.


Aang

Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield.


Sokka

You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?


Aang

Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.




Camera cuts to show the fleet of ships traveling across the sea. Cut to a view through a Bato's telescope.


Hakoda

There they are, the Great Gates of Azulon.


Katara

I don't see any gates.




Cut to Katara and Hakoda's boat.


Hakoda

Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover.


Tho

We'll sneak by them statues just like we sneak by that Fire Navy blockade!




Cut to show Katara, Due, and other swamp benders waterbending a thick fog cover.


Hakoda

Keep it up, we're almost through!




Suddenly a bell rings as a huge net rises out of the water and is set on fire. Sokka and the others are shocked to see patrol boats racing toward them


Hakoda

Everyone below deck! [Everyone goes into the boats; to Sokka.] Let's hope your invention works.




Camera shows several Fire Nation soldiers climbing onto the boats. They are shown to search the boats thoroughly, but find no one.


Male Fire Nation soldier

No one's on board, sir.


Female Fire Nation soldier

Where'd they go?




Several submarines are shown traveling beneath the gates. Inside, waterbenders are moving the subs. Cut inside a sub as the mechanist is sitting at the front. Hakoda, Sokka, Pipsqueak, and Bato are standing behind him.


Hakoda

[Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] You've really outdone yourself this time, son.




Cut to Toph, who is sitting on the floor behind them with the Duke. She is getting seasick.


Toph

[Sarcastically.] Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying. [She holds her mouth, about to throw up.]


The Duke

[Takes off his helmet and offers it to Toph.] Helmet?




Toph accepts his offer and vomits into the helmet. The Duke just places his hand on Toph's back, trying to comfort her.


Sokka

Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work.


Mechanist

Now don't sell yourself short, my boy. [Cut briefly to Katara and Huu waterbending.] It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant! [Cuts back to the mechanist opening a scroll, revealing a very crude drawing of a submarine.] Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix. [Cut to outside of submarine as the submarines swim past, along with Aang on Appa.] The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface.




The scene cuts to show Ming coming back into Iroh's cell.


Ming

Lunchtime, General Iroh. [Whispers and looks back.] And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.


Iroh

Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. [Thinks for a moment and smiles.] I think you should take the rest of the day off.


Ming

[Confused.] What?


Iroh

You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest.


Ming

No, I feel fine.


Iroh

[Brief close-up of his face.] Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon.




Ming nods, indicating that she understands. She gets up and walks out. The scene cuts to show the fleet of submarines surfaced on the water. The Duke is dipping his helmet into the water, trying to wash out Toph's vomit. Everyone is stretching as Aang lands on the submarine from Appa.


Aang

[To Toph, Sokka, and Katara, who approach him.] So, this is it huh?


Sokka

Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?


Aang

I'm ready. [Sokka and Aang shake hands and the group hugs.]


Toph

I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes.


Hakoda

Everyone listen up. [Team Avatar comes out of the hug.] The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break times over, back in the subs. [Sokka, Toph, and Momo leave Katara and Aang standing alone together.]


Aang

[Turning to see Katara.] Katara, I ...


Katara

[Speaking at the same time.] Aang, I ...


Aang

You go first.


Katara

We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. [Aang blushes.] I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.


Aang

Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it.


Katara

Yes, it is.


Aang

What if ... what if I don't come back?


Katara

Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- [Katara is cut off as Aang kisses her. After the kiss, Katara blushes and stares sadly after Aang as he confidently snaps his glider and flies away.]


Sokka

Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.


Katara

What? Right, I'm on it. [Jumps onto Appa and waterbends a sphere of water around his head before submerging.]




The scene cuts to show Zuko walking into Mai's room. He looks at a painting of them and becomes downcast.


Zuko

I'm sorry Mai.




He leaves a note on her bed and leaves. The scene cuts to show Aang flying over land. His stomach growls, and he rotates the handle of his glider to release food.


Aang

What do you know? It did come in handy.




The scene cuts to show the submarine fleet approaching land. The other end of a periscope emerges above water, looking around. Cut to inside the sub, Hakoda manning the periscope. Realizing where they are he turns around to address the earthbenders.


Hakoda

Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is gonna be a rough ride.




Toph and other earthbenders climb down a ladder in the sub and get ready. Cut to an overview of the Fire Nation port. An alarm goes off as the subs approach the gate. Several harpoons are launched at the subs, but most miss. One hits, causing a leak which is quickly sealed by a foggy swamp waterbender turning the water to ice, and pulls the attached sub out of the water. Katara quickly responds by piloting Appa out of the water and using waterbending to slice through the chain, dropping the sub back down.


Hakoda

Ready the torpedo. [An ice-covered torpedo is loaded.] Launch!




Huu launches the torpedo with waterbending. Cut outside as six torpedoes make holes in the underwater barrier, making it possible for the subs to pass through.




The scene cuts to show Toph, the Boulder, and other earthbenders standing in a metal tank. Cut to Water Tribe warriors and foggy swamp waterbenders with Sokka among them, he lets out a sigh. Cut to the subs rising from the water, being instantly attacked by missiles. The subs open and several tanks exit while the other soldiers yell and charge out. The battle commences as they make their way inland, destroying battlements as they go. Earthbenders use rocks provided by a truck containing many rocks. Appa arrives and Katara jumps off as Fire Nation tanks appear. Teo is seen inside an earthbender tank before it destroys a battlement by crushing it. Another tank lifts its front up to slam down and crush a Fire Nation tank. More Fire Nation tanks arrive as the army pushes on. The swamp benders use water provided to destroy enemy tanks.


Tho

We're a man down. Where in tarnation is Huu? [He and Due continue waterbending, launching a tank into the water.]




Suddenly a large seaweed monster is shown coming out of the water and destroys several enemy tanks, throwing one into a battlement on the ledge above.


Due

[Waves.] Hey Huu! Where you been? [The seaweed opens to reveal Huu standing inside.]


Huu

Communin' with nature. Takes a while to collect this much seaweed. [Closes the seaweed again as he sees a large fireball coming straight toward him.]




Several Fire Nation soldiers on rhinos appear shooting fireballs at a group of Water Tribe warriors. They charge, and Sokka quickly disarms one of the riders and steals his rhino.


Sokka

Dad, look out!




Hakoda grunts as he turns and deflects a fireball with his shield. He turns back to disarm a soldier and quickly defeats others before jumping on the rhino to join Sokka. The vehicle full of rocks for earthbenders is destroyed. Huu, inside the seaweed, is shown destroying more tanks. An earthbender tank is destroyed by a battlement above. Cut to Hakoda and Sokka who saw this happen.


Hakoda

Sokka, we've gotta take out those battlements! It's our only chance.


Sokka

I've got an idea.




Sokka, Hakoda, and Katara are shown riding a fully armored Appa. Sokka draws his sword and slices the end of a missile launcher off. As they fly past another, Hakoda throws two bombs inside the battlement. Cut to two soldiers running out as it explodes. Cut back to Appa as Katara breaks two barrels of water attached to either side of Appa as it forms around her arms. They fly past another battlement she freezes the soldier and launcher inside. Appa lands between two still operational battlements. The three jump off Appa.


Hakoda

You two take out that battlement. [Pointing to a battlement in the distance before leaving to another.] I got this one. Watch each other's backs. [Cut to Sokka and Katara, shown breaking into their battlement, Katara freezing the soldiers inside. Sokka uses his sword to cut through the launcher, causing part of it to fall out and explode outside as Katara and Sokka exit the battlement. They see Hakoda on the roof of his as he climbs inside. They hear noises from the ensuing fight until the launcher shoots and explodes, hearing Hakoda yelling out in pain. Cut to Sokka and Katara's worried faces as Hakoda exits, wounded, and falls to the ground.]


Katara

Dad?


Sokka

Dad! [The two run to his side.]




The camera cuts again to show Zuko kneeling at a painting of his mother.


Zuko

I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right. [He rises, picks up his sword, covers his head with the hood of his robe, turns his back to the camera and leaves.]




The scene cuts to show Appa landing on the edge of the battlefield. Sokka and Katara help Hakoda onto the ground, and Katara starts trying to heal him.


Katara

How does that feel, dad?


Hakoda

Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops. [Attempts to stand but is too weak to.] Ahh!


Katara

You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore.


Hakoda

Everyone's counting on me to lead this mission Katara, I won't let them down. [Attempts to stand again but can't.] Ahh!


Sokka

Can't you heal him any faster?


Katara

I'm doing everything I can.


Sokka

[Looks around before looking confidant.] I'll do it.


Katara

No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.


Sokka

No. [Stands confidently.] I'll lead the invasion force.


Katara

Don't be crazy Sokka.


Sokka

Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.


Hakoda

You can do this. [Cuts to a close-up of him.] I'm proud of you son.


Katara

I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.


Sokka

[Nods, puts his helmet on and boards Appa.] Yip yip.




Appa flies away as the scene cuts to show the battlefield, a mess of Fire Nation tanks destroyed everywhere. Several raised battlements fire on the army below. Appa lands and takes out an enemy tank as Sokka makes his way to the back of the saddle to rally the soldiers.


Sokka

Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. [All the tanks come together in wedge formation behind Appa, soldiers protected in the middle. Cut to Sokka, on Appa, who draws his sword and thrusts it forward.] Charge!




The scene cuts to show Aang standing on the edge of the volcano. He glides down to a building attempting to hide. He rises, confused, as there is nobody there.


Aang

[Looking around.] That's strange. [He continues onto the Royal Palace, breaks open the door, and takes a fighting stance.] The Avatar is back! [Realizing no one is around he relaxes, looking confused.] Hello? Anyone home?




The scene cuts to the tanks, which are making their way up the volcano, unaffected by fire blasts from firebenders in front. Cut to Sokka steering a vehicle full of explosives into a wall before jumping off. Cut to an aerial view showing two explosions at the inner walls. Cut to Sokka, soldiers behind him, as they charge forward. Firebenders attempt to stop them but are pushed back. Cut to Tyro running in with the other troops as Bato appears behind him.


Tyro

The Fire Nation is falling back!


Bato

Sokka, we're on our way to victory!




Sokka looks ahead as the camera cuts to show Aang airbending his way into an empty, darkened throne room.


Aang

No. [Kneels down on the ground; frustrated.] No, no, no! Fire Lord Ozai, where are you!?




Scene fades to credits.



The episode opens to the invasion of the Fire Nation where the moon can be seen gradually moving in front of the sun. Cuts to a shot of the submarines remaining stationery at the shores of the plaza. The camera pans upward, revealing the plaza empty except for Huu, disguised as the swamp monster, and several Foggy Swamp Tribe members.
Cuts to overhead shot of the plaza where the invasion carries on. The Fire Nation armies try to shoot the Earth Kingdom tanks, but they are too powerful. Earth Kingdom soldiers run about and fire boulders to counterattack the Fire Nation. A few earthbenders emerge briefly from within the Earth Kingdom tanks and hurl boulders toward the enemy. Cuts to shot of one soldier commanding catapults to launch smoldering boulders. Several fireballs are launched into the air. One lands forcefully near Sokka and a few troops who are huddled together behind a stationery Earth Kingdom tank, studying a map lying on the ground. Cuts to Sokka cringing at the sound of the explosion. Cuts to shot of Katara coming back with Hakoda, Sokka smiles at this sight.



Sokka

[Brightening.] Dad! [Rising and approaching the two.] You're on your feet again.


Hakoda

[Sitting down; somewhat weakly.] Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight, but maybe there's some way I can help.


Sokka

Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.


Hakoda

[Katara moves away, sensing something in the distance.] Let's hope our luck holds out. [Noticing her move away.] Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?


Katara

[Quizzically.] Yeah. Is that ... is that Aang?


Sokka

[Shocked.] What? [Cuts to shot of Aang riding in on his glider, dodging several fireballs. He lands in front of the group.] Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.


Aang

[Katara and Aang kneel with Sokka.] He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.


Sokka

[With epiphany; the camera shifts from a side-view of his face to a frontal view.] They knew.




Cuts to overhead shot of the group sitting together in a circle. Aang rubs his fingers along the ground idly.


Aang

[Dismayed.] It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.


Sokka

[Thoughtfully.] No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.


Toph

If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, [Points to herself.] I'm just the girl to find it.


Sokka

[Pulling out mechanism.] The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.


Aang

We can still do this. We can still win the day.


Katara

[Worried.] Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap. [Looks at the others; the camera pans to the right.] Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely.


Hakoda

Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.


Sokka

[To Aang.] What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.


Aang

[Rising, turning his back to the group, determined.] I've gotta try.




The scene changes to where Aang, Toph, and Sokka are flying on Appa to the Caldera Volcano in the Fire Nation. Appa lands on the side as the others jump off.


Aang

Do you feel anything down there?


Toph

[Placing her hand on the ground to feel vibrations.] Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.


Sokka

Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?


Toph

[Taking her hands and digging her fingers into the surface.] There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.


Sokka

[Raises arms up in the background.] Sounds like a secret bunker to me.




Toph earthbends a hole in the volcano, blowing up a cloud of dust. Sokka follows her into the tunnel.


Aang

[To Appa and Momo.] Stay safe. We'll be back soon.




He enters the tunnel into a dark cavern, with Toph leaning over and surveying the area using seismic sense.


Toph

[Pointing.] This way! That one's a dead end!


Sokka

[Following her.] What would we do without you?


Toph

[Camera view changes to show the group walking past magma channels.] Perish in burning hot magma.


Sokka

[Observing the magma channels; blushing.] Yeah, pretty much.




They arrive at a chamber where magma erupts from several spouts in the ground.


Toph

The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker.


Sokka

We'll have to be fast, but careful.




He begins walking past only for a geyser of magma to erupt, nearly striking him. Aang uses airbending to cool and solidify the gush.


Aang

How is that careful?


Sokka

I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.




The three leap and run their way through the chamber, narrowly avoiding magma spouts. They arrive to a rock ledge, completely surrounded by molten lava.


Sokka

There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.


Aang

[Spinning his staff open.] Climb aboard and hold on tight.




Scene changes to where Sokka and Toph, screaming in fear, are clinging to Aang's glider for their life as they ride swiftly over the river of lava. They reach the other side safely and approach a large metal, dome-like structure with a huge door.


Sokka

[Impressed.] That's some door!


Toph

[Walks over to the door and bangs the metal with her fist.] Not a problem.




She uses metalbending, jamming into the door with her elbows, creating cracks in the metal. She steps back several feet, kisses her fingertips and splits the door wide open. Stepping inside the interior, she points in a direction.


Sokka

[Entering the bunker while making some hand movements.] I am so glad we added you to the group!




Back at the invasion, the Fire Nation is beginning to fall back, unsuccessfully trying to deflect the attacks of the invasion force. The Boulder and The Hippo use earthbending to create landslides that collapse several battlements.


Fire Nation Captain

[Witnessing the sun as the moon begins to overshadow it.] Retreat! Everyone move to the secondary defensive position! Retreat!




The Fire Nation soldiers halt their attacks and begin escaping the scene.


Bato

[Standing from the side of an Earth Kingdom tank.] The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished.




The troops cheer gruffly and continue on their way to the capital.


Katara

[Stopping with her father.] We can wait here if you want.


Hakoda

[Determined.] No. I wanna press forward with the others.




The two resume walking. The scene changes to Aang, Toph and Sokka running down the tunnels. Qin is coming down the same hallway, whistling. The team, upon seeing him, immediately corners him, prepared to attack.


Qin

[Out of fear.] The Fire Lord's chamber is that way, down the hall, to the left, [Makes climbing motions with his fingers.] and up the stairs, you can't miss it!


Aang

[Suspicious look suddenly becomes friendly.] Thanks!




The trio continues on their way to find the Fire Lord. Qin relaxes himself, does a few double takes, and continues whistling as if nothing happened before walking away. The group continues running; Sokka pulls out his timing device.


Sokka

Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.




The approach a set of large doors. The camera focuses on a determined Aang.


Aang

I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.




He blasts the doors down with airbending. They step inside where Azula is heard speaking.


Azula

So, you are alive after all. [Aang stares at her in shock.] I had a hunch that you survived. But it doesn't matter. [Proudly.] I've known about the invasion for months.




The entire group looks at the princess in surprise and horror. Meanwhile, Zuko stands before a small metal door, a burning torch surrounding either side of it.


Zuko

[To himself.] I'm ready to face you.




He opens the door, revealing Fire Lord Ozai sitting on the far side of the room, drinking tea. The Fire Lord is surrounded by several Royal Procession guards. He sets his teacup down upon seeing the prince.


Ozai

Prince Zuko? What are you doing here?




The scene switches to outside, showing the moon nearly blocking out the entire sun. Cut to aerial view of the inside of the volcano. Cut to the army marching onward as the eclipse is beginning. The mechanist appears near the troops and addresses the troops.


Mechanist

The eclipse is starting! [Pulls out specialized eyewear and puts it on.] Put on your eclipse glasses!




The warriors stop, prop their weapons into the ground and put on their eclipse glasses. Katara and Hakoda, wearing eclipse glasses, turn to watch the eclipse. The camera zooms out, the eclipse having officially begun. The scene changes to where Zuko is confronting Ozai.


Ozai

Why are you here?


Zuko

I'm here to tell the truth.


Ozai

[Off-camera.] Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. [Cuts to shot of him.] This should be interesting.




He sends the guards out of the room. One by one the guards file out, closing the doors behind them.


Zuko

First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.


Ozai

Why would she lie to me about that?


Zuko

Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived.


Ozai

[Shocked and horrified.] What?


Zuko

In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now.


Ozai

[Rises from his seat and points toward the door.] Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!


Zuko

That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.


Ozai

[Angrily.] You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!


Zuko

[Pulls out his swords.] Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.




Ozai sits down, dismayed at the turn of events. The scene switches to Aang, Sokka and Toph confronting Azula.


Aang

Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?


Azula

[Rises from throne.] You mean I'm not good enough for you? [Acts hurt.] You're hurting my feelings.


Sokka

Stop wasting our time and give us the information. [Points sword at her.] You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.


Toph

[Appears on scene and clenches fist.] And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.


Azula

[Walking a few steps forward.] Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. [Pauses slightly.] I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.


Toph

[Cuts to Toph; short pause.] Okay, you're good, I admit it. [Traps Azula using earthbending.] But you ought to consider telling the truth anyway!




Without warning, the earth trap crumbles and breaks, leaving the trio surprised.


Azula

[Brushing off dust.] When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!




Two Dai Li agents descend into the room. Aang sends an air swipe at them with his glider; however, the agents quickly conjure up an earth wall that blocks the attack. Cut to a view of the inside of the volcano. Cuts to Bato reaching the rim of the volcano, followed by the rest of the army.


Bato

Surround the periphery! [Raises spear.] We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over! Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.




Troops from the invasion force incur several Fire Nation soldiers.


Tyro

Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.


Fire Nation soldier

We'll never surrender! [Makes frenzied motions and tries to firebend, but cannot.] Okay, we surrender. [Fire Nation soldiers back down.]




Hakoda approaches the rim of the volcano, leaning on his daughter's shoulders.


Hakoda

[Happily.] There it is: the Fire Nation Royal Palace. We've come so far.


Katara

[Doubtful.] It's not over yet.




The scene changes to where Zuko is confronting Ozai.


Zuko

For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. [Points a broadsword at his father.] My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. [Cuts to shot of Ozai, looking angered.] How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?


Ozai

[Scornful.] It was to teach you respect!


Zuko

It was cruel! And it was wrong.


Ozai

[Angrily.] Then you have learned nothing!


Zuko

No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! [Camera view shows top profile of Zuko and Ozai through an overhead grate.] We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself [Cuts to shot of Zuko.], we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.


Ozai

[Laughs.] Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?


Zuko

Yes. [Smiles proudly.] He has.




Ozai only grows more furious. The scene changes to where Team Avatar is fighting Azula and her Dai Li agents. Aang bursts through the stone wall the agents had created and the team runs toward the Fire Nation princess. A stone column erupts from the surface, which Aang manages to dodge. Toph bends two stone slabs sending the agents toward the two sidewalls of the room. The agents each land on one sidewall and send two earth pillars straight at Toph, who conjures two earth walls to block their attacks. She proceeds to send a stream of earth at Azula, who nimbly back-flips onto the throne after being pushed back by the stream. She smirks as she lands.
Aang races toward her, an agent following close behind. He looks up to catch sight of the agent rocketing along a wall. The agent lands before him and builds up an earth wall which Aang breaks through. He sends an air blast at Azula, who manages to slip away as the blast destroys the throne. Aang attempts the knock her down by sending an air swipe, however, Azula avoids his attack, acutely leaping and flipping between two metal beams. She lands on the ground deftly and continues running away.
The camera focuses on the princess as she leaps from one metal beam to the other. Aang sends another air swipe at her only to miss her yet again. Azula slides down a stone pillar created earlier by a Dai Li agent. She flips onto one of the stone walls Toph conjured up to protect herself before and jumps onto the other one before landing on the ground again. She begins running toward a stone wall. A Dai Li agent slides down a stone column to the floor where he launches Azula into the air by bending an earth pillar below her feet. The camera cuts to Sokka, as he climbs his way through the hole in the stone wall. Played out in slow-motion, Azula is seen leaping through the wall, hovering mere inches over Sokka's face, smiling evilly at him as she passes. She lands onto the ground and begins running again.
Cuts to Sokka, who dodges again to avoid a Dai Li agent, Aang and Toph who each leap through the hole, one after the other. Sokka lands to the ground and follows the group. Cuts to where Aang and Toph are running side by side.



Aang

[While running.] I can't pin her down! She's too quick!




Azula races through a door, entering a tunnel. A Dai Li agent follows close behind, earthbending a stone wall to block the entranceway. He proceeds to run after the princess. Aang bursts the wall and chases them. The Dai Li agent is suddenly pushed over by a stone column that jutted out from the side of tunnel's wall. A hole appears and Toph emerges from it. The agent lands into a crevice of a nearby metal beam and prepares to attack Toph only for the blind earthbender to destroy his rock gloves and metalbend the grooves of the beam together, trapping him. She and Aang continue chasing Azula. Sokka quickly runs up to them.


Sokka

[Stops running.] Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!


Azula

[Calmly.] Not true. I'm giving it my all.


Toph

[Angrily.] You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!


Azula

[Sarcastically.] Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. [Rolls her eyes in disgust.]


Toph

[Angrily.] I'll roll your whole head!


Sokka

She's just baiting you again.


Aang

Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?


Sokka

We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.




The trio turns to leave, walking toward the opposite end of the tunnel.


Azula

[Coolly.] It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.




Aang and Toph stop walking and turn to look at the princess, both appearing hesitant. Sokka continues to walk forward.


Sokka

[Waves hand up in gesture.] Ignore!


Azula

[Craftily.] So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. [Sokka stops walking and casts Azula a suspicious glance.] She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you.




Sokka sheds a few tears before charging at Azula in blind rage. The princess stands perfectly still.


Azula

[Evilly to herself.] Come and get it.




With a quick motion of her left hand, she reveals a hidden dagger, prepared to strike Sokka when he comes within range. Toph senses the weapon and pins Azula's hand to the tunnel wall by sending a rock aimed at her wrist. Sokka grabs her by the shoulder, coming face-to-face with her.


Sokka

Where. Is. Suki?!




The scene changes to Zuko and Ozai.


Zuko

After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. [Cuts to shot of Ozai.] He's the one who's been a real father to me.


Ozai

[Laughs.] Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.


Zuko

But I've come to an even more important decision. [Closes eyes and momentarily pauses.] I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.


Ozai

[Smugly.] Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?


Zuko

Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. [Puts his swords away.] Goodbye.


Ozai

[Camera focuses on Zuko walking away, the Fire Lord in the background, now on his feet.] Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?




Zuko abruptly stops and turns to face his father. Ozai smiles. The camera cuts to a shot of outside where the solar eclipse continues. Cut back to Zuko confronting Ozai.


Zuko

What happened that night?


Ozai

My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. [Cuts to side-view of Zuko.] Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. [Camera focuses on Ozai.] She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared.




Cuts to a close-up shot of Sokka, who narrows his eyes, angrily interrogating Azula.


Sokka

Where's Suki? Answer me!


Aang

[Grabs Sokka's shoulder as camera pans slightly to the right.] Sokka, she won't talk.


Sokka

[Ignores him.] Where are you keeping her?




The camera focuses on Azula, who grins smugly, keeping her lips sealed. The shot fades to Ozai who continues his account of the night Ursa disappeared.


Ozai

Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished.


Zuko

[Grows teary-eyed.] So she's alive?


Ozai

[Calmly.] Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. [Ozai closes his eyes. Shot fades to outside where the solar eclipse begins to end.] Your penalty will be far steeper.




Fade briefly to show the eclipse ending. Fade to Ozai as he opens his eyes and, in split seconds, generates lightning, firing the bolt at Zuko. Zuko slides back several feet from the impact of the bolt, yet manages to redirect it, sending it back to right in front of his father. The resulting explosion causes the Fire Lord to slam into the back wall, where he falls over and raises his head, his face distorted in rage as flames from the lightning attack surround him. The flag behind him falls and the camera cuts to a shot of the room, revealing that Zuko had made his escape. The scene changes to Team Avatar.


Azula

Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on.




She kicks her leg in a wide arc, sending a fire blast that nearly strikes Sokka. Sokka takes several steps back as he narrowly avoids Azula's attacks. She back-flips onto the tunnel wall and uses firebending to break free from Toph's earth cuffs. She flips forward, extending her leg forward, nearly striking Aang, who manages to dodge the incoming danger.


Azula

[Rises and smirks.] Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.




She runs away, leaving the trio dismayed.


Sokka

[Ashamed.] I fell for it! I used up all our time.


Toph

It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.


Sokka

[Sorrowfully.] And now it's too late.


Aang

Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.


Sokka

[Matter-of-factly.] No. I don't think that's a good idea.


Aang

But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.


Toph

The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends.


Aang

[Disappointed.] I guess you guys are right.


Sokka

[Placing a hand on Aang's shoulder.] You'll have another chance. I know you will.




The scene changes to outside where the Invasion force has ceased their attacks. Katara leans Hakoda against an Earth Kingdom tank.


Bato

What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?


Hakoda

I don't know. [Katara crosses her arms in scorn.] But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.




Bato looks up and suddenly becomes alarmed. The camera zooms out to Katara, who looks behind her in the same direction. Cuts to the top of the Royal Palace, where several war balloons rise into the air. Cuts to view of the entire palace, the battlefield where dozens of soldiers stand and where the war balloons continue to rise. Cuts to close-up of the balloons, Fire Nation soldiers fueling them with firebending.


Mechanist

[Off-camera.] My own invention. [Cuts to shot of him.] Oh, this is terrible!




Teo lays a hand on his father's shoulder to comfort him. Cuts to front shot of a war balloon, a much larger contraption rising behind it. Cuts to shot of the entire battlefield, showing the balloons and five airships rising into the air. Katara turns and points to the sky.


Katara

They're back!




Cut to Appa groaning as he flies in, Toph, Aang, Sokka, and Momo with him. Cuts to Aang looking at the airships. Shows shot of him and Sokka looking very dismayed at the turn of events. Cuts to an airship; camera pans to the right to reveal it entirely. Cuts to Katara running up to Appa who lands. Aang looks at her with a saddened look on his face as the camera pans to Sokka and Toph in the saddle.


Sokka

[Getting off Appa.] It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! [Toph gets off, too.] We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. [Hakoda approaches.] If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.


Aang

They've got air power, but so do I! [Cut to Aang as he opens his glider.] I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down. [He tosses his glider into the air and takes off, Momo following close behind.]


Katara

Appa, you and I can help too. [Mounts Appa and follows Aang.]




Shows front view of the airship fleet, Aang flying straight toward it, Katara coming up close behind. Cuts back to Sokka and the invasion force.


Sokka

Everyone, let's get back to the subs! [Begins running.]




Cuts back to Aang flying on his glider and Katara flying on Appa. Aang approaches a war balloon. One of the soldiers operating it sees him and fires at him. Aang twists around, dodging several fireballs. Cuts to side-view of him; he closes his glider and soars straight through the balloon, cutting through it. The balloon begins falling as it loses air. Katara approaches another balloon, swiveling around once and slicing it clean through with waterbending. The top portion of the balloon drifts upward while the rest falls downward. Cuts to where the team keeps heading toward the fleet, avoiding fireballs at every turn. Appa's armor is struck with fireballs several times; he grunts. Katara uses water shields to deflect the blasts.


Katara

We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them!


Aang

Let's join the others! [Dodges another fireball.]




Cuts to shot of the capital as they fly away. The scene changes to the capital city prison; camera pans downward to the ground where Zuko is seen running toward the building. Inside, he runs down a hallway past a guard, who crouches in fear as he passes. He arrives at the entrance to his uncle's prison cell.


Zuko

Uncle! [Zuko sees a big hole in Iroh's cell and sees Warden Poon on the ground; grabs a dazed Poon by the collar.] Where is my uncle?


Warden Poon

[Bewildered and terrified.] He's gone. He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army!




Zuko lets go of Poon and leaves. At the invasion, the team is navigating their way down the sides of the volcano. Cuts to view of the underside of an airship; a hatch at the bottom opens.


Sokka

Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!




Aang, Katara, and Appa are seen approaching in the distance. Toph bends a ceiling of earth overhead. Cuts to undersides of the airships as they release bombs. Cuts to overhead view of the invasion force as the bombs rain down and detonate. One bomb lands very near the earth ceiling, causing it to start crumbling. Toph props it up by bending two earth columns to support it. Cuts to view of the earthbending tanks, the soldiers being shaken about by the activity. The airships pass over. The team runs out from under the ceiling. Cuts to view of the Royal Plaza, the airships flying past.


Katara

Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?


Aang

[Thoughtfully.] They're heading for the beach ... [Alarmed.] They're gonna destroy the submarines!


Sokka

[Hopelessly.] How are we all going to escape?


Hakoda

[Approaching, helped by Bato.] We're not.


Sokka

[Looks determined.] Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win.


Hakoda

Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.


Katara

[Surprised.] What? [Grabs Hakoda.] We can't leave you behind! [Looks at the rest of the invasion force.] We won't leave anyone behind!


Hakoda

You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. [Katara looks back at Aang and Sokka sorrowfully.] It's the only way to keep hope alive.


Bato

The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners, but we'll all survive this battle.


Tyro

[Approaching the two.] I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get by.


Sokka

[Turning, alarmed.] They're at the beach already!




Cuts to the Royal Plaza, the shadows of the airships seen moving along the ground. Camera pans upward to the shore. Cuts to view of the swamp monster, airships flying directly overhead. Tho and Due attempt to deflect the bombs with waterbending; they manage to destroy some. The swamp monster grabs several more and tosses them away. One bomb, however, lands inside the seaweed figure and detonates. Steaming piles of seaweed land onto the ground. Huu, along with Tho and Due, emerge from the mess, defeated. Five bombs are released onto each of the submarines, destroying all five of them. The team looks on in disappointment. Sokka closes his eyes resentfully.


Mechanist

[Rising on an earth column along with Toph and helps son mount Appa.] Bye, son. [Hugs Teo.]


Teo

Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you.




The mechanist looks up at Teo as the earth column is lowered by Toph.


The Duke

[Struggling to mount Appa.] I'll miss you, Pipsqueak.


Pipsqueak

[Propping The Duke onto the saddle.] Take care, The Duke.


Haru

[Hugs his father.] We'll be back for you, Dad.


Tyro

If we don't escape on our own first.




Haru bows respectfully to Tyro.


Hakoda

[Hands on both Sokka and Katara's shoulders.] We lost today, but we've never been this close. [Kneels down to face his two children.] We tasted victory, and that counts for something.


Katara

We'll miss you, Dad. [The two hug him.]


Sokka

Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.




Cuts to shot of Hakoda embracing his children; he closes his eyes. Cuts to shot of Aang, sitting on Appa's head, tears streaming down his face. Katara approaches him, puts a hand around his shoulders and smiles at him proudly. Aang wipes away his tears and rises to face the invasion force.


Aang

Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you.




The team turns to leave on Appa. Appa moans and takes off as the team looks back sadly at those remaining. Cut to a view of those remaining watching them leave. Meanwhile, on a Fire Nation airship.


Fire Nation soldier

Should we follow them, princess?


Azula

No, they're too fast. It doesn't matter. They'll be back. [Smiles evilly.]


Aang

[Looking at the airship in the distance then looks ahead.] I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple!




Appa flies away in the distance. A war balloon approaches from behind. Cuts to Zuko, a determined look on his face as he follows them. Fades to credits.
